## Don't see your issue? Open one

You can browse [existing issues](https://github.com/l2beat/l2beat/issues) on our github repository.

If you find something wrong with the website or the data feel free to
[open an issue](https://github.com/l2beat/l2beat/issues/new).

## Cloning the repository

We encourage you to fork our repository first and then clone your fork. That way the changes you
make will be visible in your repository after you push and you can easily make pull requests. It's
easy:

https://github.com/l2beat/l2beat/fork

## Installing dependencies

To do any development work, even simple config changes you probably want to have the project running
locally. To install dependencies do the following.

1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 18. To easily manage node versions we recommend
   [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm)
2. Install [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#debian-stable), preferably through
   `npm i -g yarn`
3. In the repository root run `yarn` to install project specific dependencies

## Running the website locally

If you're planning working only on the frontend part of the website (i.e. you don't care what data
is actually displayed) then it's quite easy. Just run the following commands after having cloned the
repository:

```
yarn
yarn build:frontend
cd packages/frontend
yarn start
```

## Add your Layer 2 project to the website

If you want to add a new Layer 2 project you can do that by opening a PR. To do this you need to:

1. Read the specification in `packages/config/src/layer2s/types/Layer2.ts`. It contains an annotated
   data format for the project definition.
2. Add a .ts file to describe your project inside `packages/config/src/layer2s`. You can use the
   existing projects as reference.
3. Add your project into `packages/config/src/layer2s/index.ts`. The order of the projects should be
   kept alphabetical.
4. Add an 128x128 png project icon under 10KB into `packages/frontend/src/static/icons`.
5. If your project is a fork of an already existing project (like Boba Network that is on top of
   Optimism) or it was built using a Rollups SDK/framework (like ImmutableX that is on top of
   StarkEx) you can show this information by:
   - In your project's .ts file find the field `technology`, add a field `provider` (if it is not
     already) and set the technology provider your project is based on.
   - If the technology provider in which your project is based on is not defined in L2BEAT yet, you
     will need to:
     - Add the new provider in the file `packages/config/src/layer2s/types/Layer2.ts` (find the
       optional property `provider`).
     - Create a simple React component to render the technology provider Icon (SVG format required)
       inside `packages/frontend/src/components/icons/providers`.
     - Import the Icon component created in `packages/frontend/src/components/icons/index.ts`.
     - Add an entry for the technology provider in the provider's Legend that is located at
       `packages/frontend/src/components/ScalingLegend.tsx`.
     - To finish, add the technology provider icon in the technology column of the project's table
       that is located at `packages/frontend/src/components/table/TechnologyCell.tsx`.
6. Open a PR :D

Adding a new project in this way will automatically update both the data fetching logic as well as
the frontend.

## Add your Layer 3 project to the website

If you want to add a new Layer 3 project you can do that by opening a PR. To do this you need to:

1. Read the specification in `packages/config/src/layer3s/types/Layer3.ts`. It contains an annotated
   data format for the project definition.
2. Add a .ts file to describe your project inside `packages/config/src/layer3s`. You can use the
   existing projects as reference. Remember to specify host chain on which your project is based on.
   Take `projectId` of host chian and add it to `hostChain` property.
3. Add your project into `packages/config/src/layer3s/index.ts`. The order of the projects should be
   kept alphabetical.
4. Add an 128x128 png project icon under 10KB into `packages/frontend/src/static/icons`.
5. If your project is a fork of an already existing project (like Boba Network that is on top of
   Optimism) or it was built using a Rollups SDK/framework (like ImmutableX that is on top of
   StarkEx) you can show this information by:
   - In your project's .ts file find the field `technology`, add a field `provider` (if it is not
     already) and set the technology provider your project is based on.
6. Open a PR :D

### Add missing tokens

If while adding your project you find that some of the tokens locked in it are missing from our
token list do not worry.

1. Read the token definition in `packages/config/src/tokens.ts`
2. Check if the token matches the requirements.
3. Add your token to the list. The order of the tokens should be kept alphabetical.

## Contribute research

Each project defined in `packages/config/src/projects` described by a set of parameters
(`details.parameters`). Those values are a result of research conducted by the L2BEAT contributors.
As with all research there may be mistakes, outdated information or missing data in those files.

You are encouraged to provide your feedback on the data presented on L2BEAT by
[opening an issue](https://github.com/l2beat/l2beat/issues/new). Once consensus is reached on what
the data presented should be we also very much welcome PRs.

## Contribute code

The L2BEAT website repository is a monorepo consisting of many interdependent packages.

1. `packages/shared` - utils and types used by the other packages
2. `packages/config` - the shared configuration that defines what projects and tokens are tracked by
   the website
3. `packages/backend` - a backend server that downloads balances from chain and exposes and API for
   the frontend
4. `packages/frontend` - statically generated site which displays data fetched from the backend API

To learn more about each of the projects read their respective README's.
