# DeFiDisco Development Guide

## L2BEAT Architecture Reference

### Core System Overview

**L2BEAT** is a TypeScript monorepo for analyzing Ethereum Layer 2 protocols. **DeFiDisco** is a fork enhanced for DeFi analysis.

**Key Packages:**

- **`discovery`**: Core contract analysis engine (keep unchanged)
- **`protocolbeat`**: React UI with Monaco editor
- **`l2b`**: CLI tool and API server
- **`config`**: Project configurations and results

**Commands:**

```bash
# Setup and run
pnpm install && pnpm build:dependencies
cd ~/defidisco/packages/config && l2b ui  # http://localhost:2021/ui

# Sync upstream
git fetch upstream && git merge upstream/main
```

### Discovery System

**Automated Analysis:** Discovery automatically analyzes any contract by:

- Calling all view/pure functions with 0 parameters
- Testing array functions with indices 0-4
- Detecting proxy patterns and relationships
- Applying templates for known contract types

**Template System:** Contracts matched by bytecode hash to templates in `packages/config/src/projects/_templates/`

**Handler System:** Custom handlers in `packages/discovery/src/discovery/handlers/user/` for specialized analysis

### Data Flow

1. **Config** (`config.jsonc`) → Discovery engine
2. **Analysis** → Results in `discovered.json`
3. **Backend** monitors changes → Frontend displays data

## DeFiDisco Architecture

### Minimal Integration Principle ⭐

**Core Philosophy**: Minimize modifications to original L2BEAT files to ensure easy upstream merges

### Code Organization

**DeFiDisco folders** (keep all our code here):

- `packages/protocolbeat/src/defidisco/` - All UI components, extensions, icons
- `packages/l2b/src/implementations/discovery-ui/defidisco/` - All backend modules
- `packages/discovery/src/discovery/handlers/defidisco/` - Discovery handlers

**Integration points** (minimal modifications only):

- `ValuesPanel.tsx` - Single `<ValuesPanelExtensions>` line
- `TerminalPanel.tsx` - Single `<TerminalExtensions>` line
- `main.ts` - API endpoint registrations + `dotenv.config()` at module entry so `l2b ui` picks up `.env` from cwd (DATABASE_URL, OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.)
- `api.ts` - DeFiDisco API functions (unavoidable)
- `DiscoveryApp.tsx` - Single route entry per top-level page (e.g. `/ui/monitor-admin`)
- `HomePage.tsx` - Entry buttons for top-level DeFiDisco pages
- **Cross-chain discovery glue in the core `discovery` package** (required because DeFiDisco analyzes L2 protocols that upstream L2BEAT discovery didn't originally target; keep these edits narrow and well-commented):
  - `packages/discovery/src/config/chains.ts` - Switch Base from `etherscan` to `blockscout` explorer so Slither and discovery can fetch verified sources from `base.blockscout.com` without an Etherscan API key
  - `packages/discovery/src/flatten/ParsedFilesManager.ts` - Deduplicate files that share a `normalizedPath` after remapping. Blockscout returns both the user-facing import path and the library path (e.g. `@openzeppelin/...` + `lib/openzeppelin-contracts/...`), which then collide during flattening
  - `packages/discovery/src/utils/BlockscoutModels.ts` - Loosen the `CompilerSettings.libraries` schema to accept both the flat `Record<string, string>` shape (older contracts) and the nested `Record<string, Record<string, string>>` shape (newer Blockscout payloads)

### Repository Setup

- **Fork**: `~/defidisco/` (complete L2BEAT fork)
- **Why Fork**: Avoids dependency issues with unpublished internal packages
- **Benefits**: Full toolchain access, easy upstream sync

## Feature Index

Detailed documentation for each feature is in `docs/developers/features/`. Read the relevant doc when working on a specific feature.

**Data Pipeline**: See `docs/developers/architecture.md` § "Data Pipeline: From Discovery to Frontend" for the end-to-end transformation chain (5 stages) covering how admins, dependencies, and funds flow from source data through scoring, compilation, and into the frontend.

**Forward BFS through deps and upgrades**: manual `dependencies` in `functions.json` and upgrade functions are non-leaf — forward BFS continues through them for auto-detected dep surfaces, capital reachability, and transitive mitigation collection. `edgeType: 'dependency'` edges emitted by `buildEnhancedGraph` (excluded from backward ownership-chain traversal). Full semantics, seeding rules, and perf notes in `docs/developers/features/permissions.md` § "Manual dependency transitive reachability" and "Mitigations".

### Permissions — `docs/developers/features/permissions.md`
- AI-Based Permission Detection (GPT-4 / Claude, endpoint + prompt engineering)
- Interactive Permission Management (ValuesPanelExtensions, 4 attributes, delay field)
- Permissions Report Generation (terminal markdown table via SSE)
- AccessControl Role Support (OpenZeppelin handler, path expressions)
- Continuous Permission Monitoring (automated change detection, Discord alerts)
- Permission Overrides Data Structure (contract-grouped JSON, owner path syntax, resolution logic)
- Permission Scan Agent (`/scan-permissions` Claude Code skill — source code analysis for permissioned functions, owner path construction, verification against discovered data)
- Impact Analysis Agent (`/analyze-impact` Claude Code skill — traces storage writes through read sites to classify temporal fund impact: retroactive vs future-only)
- Add Mitigation Agent (`/add-mitigation` Claude Code skill — finds on-chain constraints in source code, builds structured mitigation entries in functions.json)
- Scoring Agent (`/score-contract` Claude Code skill — batch impact analysis + scoring + mitigation finding for all permissioned functions on a contract)

### Call Graph Analysis — `docs/developers/features/call-graph-analysis.md`
- Slither-based external call detection (SlithIR parsing, heuristic resolution engine)
- Enhanced Traversal (unified graph: call graph + permission edges, backward BFS for governance chains, forward BFS for capital analysis)
- Upgrade Function Detection (`isUpgradeFunction()` in `types.ts` — BFS seeding expands upgrade functions to all contract functions in both `traverseWithPaths` and `traverseForward`)
- Function Analysis (forward BFS for impact + dependency detection)
- Shared traversal helpers (`traverseWithPaths`, `findContractGraph`, `extractChainAddresses`)

### Scoring & Review — `docs/developers/features/scoring-and-review.md`
- ProjectAnalysis API (`/admins`, `/dependencies` endpoints — single source of truth for admin/dependency computation)
- Scoring UI (inventory sections, shared `scoringShared.tsx` module, capital display, enhanced graph capital analysis)
- Upgrade Function Capital (`isUpgrade` flag in data pipeline, UPGRADE badges in UI — upgrade functions seed BFS with all contract functions for full capital exposure)
- Shared-Implementation Fan-Out (factory-deployed proxy patterns — Aave ATokens, debt tokens, etc. — treated as templates: one impl-keyed entry in `functions.json` fans out to N admin/dependency rows at read time, one per proxy, with `$self` rebinding per proxy and funds/permissions resolved against each proxy. Handled via `buildImplToProxiesMap`/`buildProxyToImplsMap` in `addressUtils.ts`, threaded through `getAdmins` / `getDependencies` / `buildEnhancedGraph` / `buildFunctionsMetadataLookup` / `CapitalAnalysisCalculator`. Storage stays impl-keyed — researcher writes once. Full design + verification in `docs/developers/designs/shared-impl-fan-out.md`.)
- Review Builder (`review-config.json`, entity descriptions, templates)
- Resources (`resources.json` — wrapper object `{ resources, audits, linesOfCode? }` per project, auto-saves independently)
- Audits (`audits` array in `resources.json` — `AuditEntry[]` with `url`, `author`, `date`, `scope?`, `bounty?`; `bounty` = max bug bounty USD amount; separate from `ResourceEntry[]`)
- Lines of Code (`countLinesOfCode.ts` — declaration-level dedup of flattened Solidity files: parses `library`/`contract`/`abstract contract`/`interface` blocks with brace-depth tracking, dedupes by name across all `.flat/` files to handle inlined libraries. Skips external contracts, dedupes by `sourceHashes`. Auto-runs inside `reviewCompiler.compile()` and persisted to `resources.json.linesOfCode`; also exposed via "Count Lines of Code" button and `POST /api/projects/:project/count-lines-of-code`. Displayed in defiscan-frontend `CodeQualitySection` as "X,XXX LoC")
- Resource Gathering Agent (`/gather-resources` Claude Code skill — web search + verify for official links, licenses, socials, security audits, and bug bounty programs; `--audits-only` flag skips resource gathering and only discovers/saves audits using existing resources as starting points)
- Review Generation Agent (`/generate-review` Claude Code skill)
- Governance (`governance.json` — separate per-project file storing `GovernanceConfig`: framework, vote execution, voting unit, proposal requirements, voting process, proposal period + execution delay as `fieldRef`/`fixed`/`none` durations. `fieldRef` carries an optional `unit` (`seconds`|`blocks`|`minutes`|`hours`|`days`, default `seconds`; `blocks` = 12s Ethereum block time) so the compiler can convert raw on-chain values — required for Compound/OZ Governor `votingPeriod` which is in blocks. Auto-saves via its own `/api/projects/:project/governance` CRUD endpoints. Survives `/generate-review` wipes. Legacy fallback reads from `review-config.json.governance` and migrates on next write. Compiled into `compiled-review.json.governance` via `governanceCompiler.ts` with field refs resolved against `discovered.json` and unit converted via local `unitToSecondsFactor`. Editor `ReviewGovernanceEditor.tsx` exposes the unit dropdown and mirrors the same factor in its live preview. Rendered in defiscan-frontend's `GovernanceSection`)
- Governance Agent (`/generate-governance` Claude Code skill — research protocol governance, map periods/delays to on-chain numeric fields, **pick the right `unit` per fieldRef** (notably `"blocks"` for Compound/OZ Governor `votingPeriod`), write `governance.json`; never touches `review-config.json`)
- Review Compiler (`compiled-review.json` — thin assembly layer over ProjectAnalysis, template variable resolution, bulk compile-all endpoint, `adminTotals`/`dependencyTotals` for cross-entity deduplicated capital. `totals.coverage` / `totals.verifiedContractCount` are computed by `computeCoverage(discovery)` from `discovered.json.entries[].unverified` — non-EOA entries are verified when `unverified !== true`)
- Impact Cap (`impactCap` on mitigations — structured field reference or hardcoded USD, `ImpactCapUnit` scaling, `effectiveCapUsd` on reachable contracts, "$X Max Impact" badge display. `traverseForward` folds both source path cap and target-function cap into each edge; view-call edges contribute 0 so reads never uncap a capped target. `analyzeAdminCapital` applies the same max-per-contract cap to `directContracts` so direct totals respect per-function caps.)
- Mitigations Display (badges in explorer tabs + report cards, key findings card, `aggregateMitigationsByImpact` for entity-level surfaces and `deduplicateMitigations` for plain dedup)
- Radar Scoring (`deriveRadarData()` in `packages/defiscan-frontend/src/utils/radar.ts` — 5-axis scores for ADMIN CONTROL / DEPENDENCIES / ACCESS / VERIFIABILITY / GOVERNANCE driving the Report hero, Gallery radar charts, and Landing Trust Posture; full per-axis tiers in the scoring-and-review doc)

### Infrastructure — `docs/developers/features/infrastructure.md`
- DeFiScan Panel (contract analysis dashboard)
- External Contract Attributes & Governance Tag (entity grouping, node coloring)
- Contract Tags data structure (`contract-tags.json`, cleanup rules)
- Funds Tracking (DeBank API, Morpho vault onchain positions, `funds-data.json`, aggregate funds via The Graph subgraphs)
- DeFiScan Frontend (static React app, Vercel deployment, shareable report view, TVS metric, mitigation badges in report cards). **Three-timestamp model on `CompiledReview`**: `publishedAt` (first time `review-config.json` was ever created — preserved forever across regenerations via `writeReviewConfig` chokepoint, plus out-of-band `/tmp/review-config-$0-publishedAt.txt` preservation in the `/generate-review` skill which bypasses the backend API), `lastModified` (last researcher edit to `review-config.json` / `resources.json` — bumps via `writeReviewConfig` or `updateResources`/`updateAudits` with `bumpLastModified: true`; `updateLinesOfCode` explicitly calls `writeResourcesFile(..., false)` so compile-side LoC recounts do NOT bump `lastModified`. `governance.json` is NOT a source — its filesystem mtime is unreliable in CI), and `compiledAt` (live on-chain data freshness — sourced from `discovered.json.timestamp` in `reviewCompiler.ts`, NOT wall-clock compile time, so researcher-triggered recompiles without a fresh discovery cycle keep it frozen). Separate signal: **latest on-chain activity** is derived from the newest `review.activity[].timestamp` (not from any compiled timestamp) via the shared helper `getLatestActivityTimestamp(review)` in `pages/review/views/activityTimestamp.ts`. `HeroSection` shows "Latest activity: <date>" using the activity-event source (line hidden when no events); `TimestampsFooter` (standalone component rendered as the final section of `ReportView`, below Protocol Activity) shows three info pills — **Published** (with "(last modified <date>)" parenthetical appended from `lastModified`), **Latest activity** (newest `review.activity[]` timestamp, renders "No updates" when empty), and **On-chain data** (`compiledAt`); `ActivityView` "Last Verified" keeps `compiledAt` (semantics match); `LandingPage` ranks "recently updated" by `lastModified`. Gallery cards show the VERIFIED/UNVERIFIED status pill — see the Gallery Page entry below. `ReviewConfig.publishedAt?: string` is optional on the type but backfilled in `getReviewConfig` (falls back to `lastModified`) and preserved in `writeReviewConfig` by reading the existing file first. `resources.json` carries its own optional `lastModified` field. All three compiled timestamps are assembled at the `reviewCompiler.buildCompiledReview` return site, taking the max of `reviewConfig.lastModified` / `getResourcesLastModified` for `lastModified`
  - Search Modal (`SearchModal.tsx` + `SearchModalContext.tsx` — global protocol/contract search overlay triggered from Header and LandingPage hero. Filters `useIndex()` protocols by name/chain/slug/type and `useAllReviews()` contracts by name/address in real-time as the user types. Shows PROTOCOLS section (logo, chain badge, VERIFIED badge if review exists, VIEW REPORT link) and CONTRACTS section (icon, truncated address, Etherscan link). No-results state with CLEAR SEARCH button. Footer links to Tally feedback form via `FeedbackModalContext`. Max 5 results per section. ESC / backdrop click closes. `SearchModalProvider` wraps Layout; `useSearchModal().openSearchModal(query?)` to trigger.)
  - Feedback Modal Context (`FeedbackModalContext.tsx` — shared open/close state for the Tally feedback form, consumed by both `FeedbackButton` and `SearchModal`'s "Request Protocol Listing" link)
  - Gallery Page (`/gallery` — card grid of all protocols with radar chart, filters, pagination, status badge. **Status badges**: VERIFIED = a researcher has reviewed and attested the AI-generated content; UNVERIFIED = AI-generated draft not yet reviewed. Driven by `CompiledReview.verified` (sourced from `ReviewConfig.verified ?? true`). Missing field on legacy reviews reads as VERIFIED — they were researcher-curated. Toggled via the **Mark as Verified / Mark as Unverified** button in `TerminalExtensions` (protocolbeat); the `/generate-review` skill writes `verified: false` on first-time creation but preserves prior `verified` on regen via the out-of-band `/tmp/review-config-$0-verified.txt` file. Shared `StatusPill` component in `pages/review/views/StatusPill.tsx` is used by both Gallery cards (`variant="card"`) and the report `HeroSection` (`variant="hero"`). The previous ACTIVE/UPDATED concept (7-day activity window) was abandoned — `getLatestActivityTimestamp` still drives the "Last Activity" subtext on cards and the hero/footer "Latest activity" lines, but no longer drives any status pill. Filter pills toggle between VERIFIED and UNVERIFIED subsets. `verified` is mirrored into `index.json` per protocol (`ProtocolSummary.verified`) so the filter and pill render without loading every full review.)
  - Report Page redesign (outer frame sections for admins/deps/TVS/activity/governance, ShowMore opens modal with explorer tab content, empty states, hero with Verified/Unverified badge)
  - About Page (`/about` — marketing page with live stats via `useIndex()`. **Total Value Verified = `globalTotals.totalCapitalAtRisk + globalTotals.totalTokenValue`** — do NOT use `totalDefiTvl` (hardcoded constant for "% of DeFi reviewed" denominator only).)
- Activity Feed (full protocol change timeline merged from two sources. **Upgrades** still come from `$pastUpgrades` on proxy contracts. **Everything else** — role updates, parameter tweaks, contract add/remove — comes from a per-project `activity.json` file reconciled from the `UpdateNotifier` Postgres table by `DefidiscoMonitorApplication.reconcileActivity`. The classifier lives in `packages/l2b/src/implementations/discovery-ui/defidisco/activityClassifier.ts`: skips `$implementation`/`$pastUpgrades`/`$upgradeCount` (covered by upgrade events), surfaces `$admin` as `role-update` with `roleName: 'ProxyAdmin'`, maps `accessControl.<ROLE>.members`, `owner`, `pendingOwner`, Safe `$members`/`$threshold` to role updates, and classifies everything else as `data-change`. **Schema v1.1 (events grouped per contract per cycle)**: `DataChangeEvent` and `RoleUpdateEvent` carry a `changes: FieldChange[]` array (where `FieldChange = { field, before, after }`) instead of one event per field. The classifier buckets all field diffs from a single `(updateNotifierId, address)` pair into one `data-change` event plus one `role-update` event per distinct `roleName` — so a contract with 50 ticking fields produces 1 row instead of 50. New event ids are deterministic per `(updateNotifierId, address, bucket)` for idempotent dedup, with four distinct forms built by `makeDataChangeId`/`makeRoleUpdateId`/`makeContractEventId`: `${updateNotifierId}:${address}:data-change`, `${updateNotifierId}:${address}:role:${roleName}`, `${updateNotifierId}:${address}:contract-added`, and `${updateNotifierId}:${address}:contract-removed`. `ActivityFile.version = '1.1'`; on read, version mismatch logs a one-line reset message and returns an empty file with `lastConsumedUpdateNotifierId: 0`, so the next monitor reconcile triggers a full historical backfill from the DB (which is the source of truth). No in-place migration. File helpers are in `activity.ts` (`readActivityFile`/`writeActivityFile`/`getActivityEvents`); the monitor walks `UpdateNotifierRepository.getNewerThanId(project, cursor)` using the monotonic row id as cursor. `reviewCompiler.ts` widens `ActivityEvent` to a discriminated union `UpgradeEvent | DataChangeEvent | RoleUpdateEvent | ContractAddedEvent | ContractRemovedEvent` and merges both streams sorted by timestamp desc. Frontend `describeActivityEvent` switches on `event.type` and on `changes.length` — count=1 keeps the original "X changed from Y to Z" wording; count>1 produces a "{count} fields changed (a, b, c and N more)" summary. Each row is **click-to-expand**: clicking a `data-change`/`role-update` row toggles an inline `FieldChangesPanel` (table with Field|Before|After columns, strips the `accessControl.<ROLE>.` prefix for role updates) — single-open semantics, one row open at a time. The Source column shows the contract Etherscan link for all events; upgrades render the tx hash as a secondary line underneath. Standalone `ActivityView` is a Figma-based table page — hero with stats grid, Notification Channels section (Telegram-only, "Upcoming" state), and a Date/Update Type/Description/Source/Severity table with client-side pagination. Treated as a child of the report: `ViewModeToggle` is hidden on the activity tab and the back link reads "Back to report" (`?view=report`), not "Back to gallery". Report page's `ActivitySection` and `ActivityView` share the `describeActivityEvent` helper and `FieldChangesPanel` component in `pages/review/views/` — `describeActivityEvent` has an `omitName` mode for callers that render the contract name as a separate title.)
- Monitor Admin Dashboard (`/ui/monitor-admin` — researcher-facing cleanup UI for the `UpdateNotifier` Postgres table. Lists every persisted monitor cycle row grouped by project, with totals (rows / fields / projects). Each row expands inline into `RowDetailPanel`: a checkbox table grouped by contract showing every `(field, before, after)` tuple. Two destructive actions: **Strip selected fields** (mutates the row's `diffJsonBlob` to remove the chosen `(address, key)` pairs, deleting the row entirely if all fields are stripped) and **Delete whole row** (drops the row outright). Both cascade into `activity.json` so the live activity feed stays consistent — strip uses `removeActivityEventsForFields` which walks the matching grouped event's `changes[]` array and prunes only the requested entries (dropping the event when its `changes[]` becomes empty); delete uses `removeActivityEventsForRow` which drops every event tagged with that `updateNotifierId`. Both report the field-change count uniformly (units match across actions). Optional **"Also add to ignoreInWatchMode"** toggle promotes bare field names (e.g. `values.totalSupply` → `totalSupply`) into `overrides[address].ignoreInWatchMode` in `config.jsonc` via `jsonc-parser` — comment-preserving — so the field stops triggering future Discord alerts. Skips proxy escapes (`$admin`, `$implementation`) and structural fields (`accessControl.X.members`) which aren't valid `ignoreInWatchMode` entries. After every mutation the page recompiles the project's review (`safeCompile`) so `compiled-review.json` reflects the cleanup. Backend module: `packages/l2b/src/implementations/discovery-ui/defidisco/monitorAdmin.ts` (`createMonitorAdminClient`/`listMonitorRows`/`getMonitorRow`/`deleteMonitorRow`/`stripMonitorFields`/`addFieldsToIgnoreWatchMode`). Endpoints in `main.ts`: `GET /api/defidisco/monitor/health`, `GET /rows`, `GET /rows/:id`, `POST /rows/:id/delete`, `POST /rows/:id/strip` — **all gated on `process.env.DATABASE_URL`**. When unset the endpoints return `503` and the page renders an "unavailable" notice. Mutations also respect the `--readonly` flag on `l2b ui` (return `403`). New DB methods on `UpdateNotifierRepository`: `deleteById(id)` and `updateDiff(id, diff)`. `main.ts` calls `dotenv.config()` at module entry so `l2b ui` invoked from `packages/config/` picks up the project `.env` (DATABASE_URL, OPENAI/ANTHROPIC keys, etc.) — existing `process.env` values still take precedence. Frontend: `MonitorAdminPage.tsx` (table grouped by project, Inspect/Collapse buttons) and `RowDetailPanel.tsx` (select-all/clear, success/error toasts). Routed in `DiscoveryApp.tsx`; entry button on `HomePage.tsx`.)
- Continuous Monitoring Service (GitHub Actions cron, discovery + diff + funds + activity + compile). The monitor writes fresh discovery back to `packages/config/src/projects/<project>/discovered.json` via `saveDiscoveredJson` immediately after the DB upsert (see `DefidiscoMonitorApplication.writeDiscoveredJson`), then reconciles `activity.json` from `UpdateNotifier` rows via `reconcileActivity` (before compile, so the compiler sees a consistent file). The GH Actions workflow mounts `packages/config/src/projects` into the container and commits the updated `discovered.json`, `activity.json`, `funds-data.json`, and compiled reviews. Without this step `$pastUpgrades`, the activity feed, and the compiled review would stay frozen at whatever the last manual `l2b discover` run produced
- Discovery Agent (`/run-discovery` Claude Code skill — iterative contract discovery, external/governance/funds tagging, handler configuration, array overflow error fixing)
- Watch Field Pruning Agent (`/prune-watch-fields` Claude Code skill — classifies discovered fields as safe-to-ignore vs security-critical, updates `ignoreInWatchMode` in config.jsonc, also available as optional step in `/run-discovery`)

## Development Guidelines

### Minimal Integration Principle

**ALWAYS write new code in `/defidisco/` folders**

- UI components → `packages/protocolbeat/src/defidisco/`
- Backend modules → `packages/l2b/src/implementations/discovery-ui/defidisco/`
- Discovery handlers → `packages/discovery/src/discovery/handlers/defidisco/`

**Integration points should be minimal:**

- Single import + single component usage in UI files
- API functions in `api.ts` (unavoidable for frontend consumption)
- Endpoint registration in `main.ts` (unavoidable for routing)

### Development Patterns

**Handler Development:**

1. Create in `/defidisco/` folder, register in main `index.ts`
2. **Critical**: Run `pnpm run generate-schemas && pnpm build`
3. Handler config must wrap in `"handler"` object

**UI Development:**

1. Create extension components in `/defidisco/`
2. Use React Query with proper cache invalidation
3. Implement optimistic updates with error rollback

**Common Mistakes:**

- ❌ Writing DeFiDisco code in original L2BEAT files
- ❌ Not regenerating schemas after handler changes
- ❌ Mixing discovered data with user data
- ❌ Using non-existent hooks (check existing patterns in `/defidisco/` files)
- ❌ Address format mismatches (contracts use `eth:0x...`, tags use `0x...`)
- ❌ Using `??` instead of `!== undefined` for optional fields that can be explicitly cleared
- ❌ Forgetting to rebuild both `protocolbeat` AND `l2b` after backend changes
- ❌ Duplicating scoring utilities — use `scoringShared.tsx` (`OwnerSection`, capital display)
- ❌ Computing admin/dependency data in the compiler or frontend — change `ProjectAnalysis` instead
- ❌ Joining contract-tags client-side for isExternal/isGovernance — these are in the `/admins` response
- ❌ Adding a `governance` field to `ReviewConfig` — governance lives in its own `governance.json` with its own CRUD module (`governance.ts`), same pattern as `resources.json`. Keeps `/generate-review` from wiping authored governance.

**Proxy/Implementation Pattern:**

- Proxy contracts contain **both** proxy and implementation ABIs in their `contract.abis[]` array
- When rendering ABIs, each address gets a separate section (implementation functions shown under implementation address)
- Fields are stored on the **proxy contract**, not implementations
- Use `findContractForAddress()` helper in `FunctionFolder.tsx` - automatically resolves implementation addresses to their parent proxy
- Backend converts all `contract.values` to `contract.fields[]` array, so always use fields (no need for values fallback)
- **Shared-impl fan-out**: when a single implementation is used by N proxies (factory-deployed token patterns like Aave ATokens — 18 proxies sharing one impl), function metadata stored at the impl address is treated as a **template** and fanned out to N virtual rows at analysis time — one per proxy, with `$self` rebinding to each specific proxy. This is read-time expansion only: storage stays impl-keyed, researcher edits remain in one place. The fan-out happens in `buildImplToProxiesMap` / `buildProxyToImplsMap` (`addressUtils.ts`) and is threaded through `getAdmins`, `getDependencies`, `buildEnhancedGraph` (permission edges), `buildFunctionsMetadataLookup`, `buildMitigationsLookup`, `buildResolvedImpactCaps`, and `CapitalAnalysisCalculator`. Because of this, **`$self.FIELD` paths on impl-stored metadata correctly rebind per proxy** — use them for AccessControl roles, per-proxy admin fields, etc. Full design in `docs/developers/designs/shared-impl-fan-out.md`.

### Data Access Patterns

**API Access**: For new components, follow existing patterns:

- **Admins Data**: Use `useQuery` with `getAdmins(project)` or `getAdmins(project, contractAddress)` for per-contract filtering
- **Dependencies Data**: Use `useQuery` with `getDependencies(project)` or `getDependencies(project, contractAddress)` for per-contract filtering
- **Project Data**: Use `useQuery` with `getProject(project)` from `api.ts`
- **Contract Tags**: Use `useContractTags(project)` hook — note: `isExternal`/`isGovernance`/`entity` are already included in admin/dependency API responses, so new components rarely need this hook directly
- **Permission Overrides**: Use `useQuery` with `getPermissionOverrides(project)` directly (no hook exists)
- **Resources**: Use `useQuery` with `getResources(project)` — auto-saves on mutation via `updateResources()`, no panel Save button needed. Stored in `resources.json` (separate from review-config)
- **Audits**: Use `useQuery` with `getAudits(project)` — auto-saves on mutation via `updateAudits(project, audits[])`. Stored in same `resources.json` under `audits[]`, separate array from resources. `bounty` field (optional number) on an entry = max bug bounty USD (shown in defiscan-frontend Bug Bounty stat)
- **Lines of Code**: Stored as `linesOfCode?: number` in the same `resources.json` wrapper. No React Query hook — the value is produced automatically by `reviewCompiler.compile()` (inline step 4) and surfaced via `compiled-review.json.totals.linesOfCode`. Manual recount: `countLinesOfCode(project)` API function + "Count Lines of Code" button in TerminalExtensions. Backend helpers: `getLinesOfCode`/`updateLinesOfCode` in `resources.ts`. Never count raw flat file lines — always go through `countLinesOfCode.ts` so inlined-library duplication is removed.
- **Governance**: Use `useQuery` with `getGovernance(project)` — auto-saves on mutation via `updateGovernance(project, governance | null)`. Stored in `governance.json` (separate from review-config, survives `/generate-review` wipes). Pass `null` to delete the file. Never add governance to `ReviewConfig` — it's intentionally not on that type.
- **EOA Counting**: EOAs stored separately in `entry.eoas[]` array, not mixed with contracts

### Address Handling

**IMPORTANT**: Address format mismatches are a top source of bugs. Two separate `addressUtils.ts` files exist — use the right one for your context.

**Format rules**:
- All data files use chain-prefixed format: `eth:0xChecksummed` (also `arb1:`, `base:`, etc.)
- **Do NOT strip** the chain prefix unless specifically needed for display
- **NEVER** compare addresses with `===` directly — use the utilities below

**Frontend** (`packages/protocolbeat/src/apps/discovery/defidisco/addressUtils.ts`):
- `addressesEqual(a, b)` — case-insensitive comparison, handles mixed prefix formats
- `normalizeForLookup(address)` — ensures chain prefix + lowercase, use as map/object key
- `findByAddress(items, getAddress, target)` — find item in array by address field match
- `stripChainPrefix(address)` — for display only (removes `eth:` etc.)
- `ensureChainPrefix(address)` — add `eth:` if missing
- `shortenAddress(address)` — `"0x1234...abcd"` for display

**Backend** (`packages/l2b/src/implementations/discovery-ui/defidisco/addressUtils.ts`):
- `normalizeChainAddress(raw)` — canonical form: chain prefix + ERC-55 checksummed hex. Use at ingestion boundaries
- `addressesEqual(a, b)` — same as frontend but uses checksummed normalization
- `ensureChainPrefix(address)` — normalizes and adds prefix
- `buildAddressSet(addresses)` / `isInAddressSet(address, set)` — normalized Set for O(1) lookups
- `buildAddressMap(entries)` / `getFromAddressMap(map, address)` — normalized Map
- `getFromAddressRecord(record, address)` — lookup in `Record<string, T>` with normalization + legacy fallback scan

**Key difference**: Backend normalizes via ERC-55 checksumming (`EthereumAddress()`), frontend normalizes via `toLowerCase()`. Both handle mixed prefix/no-prefix inputs.

**When to use what**:
- Comparing two addresses → `addressesEqual()`
- Building a lookup structure → backend: `buildAddressSet`/`buildAddressMap`, frontend: `normalizeForLookup()` as key
- Looking up in a `Record<string, T>` from discovered.json → backend: `getFromAddressRecord()`
- Finding in an array → frontend: `findByAddress()`
- Storing/persisting addresses → always chain-prefixed + checksummed

### Key Data Structures

**Permission Overrides** (`permission-overrides.json`): Contract-grouped format with `contracts[address].functions[]`. Each function has `functionName`, `userClassification`, `checked`, `score` (`'unscored' | 'critical' | 'no-impact'`), `description`, `ownerDefinitions`, `delay`, `aiClassification`, `timestamp`. `'no-impact'` means the researcher confirmed the function has no fund impact — its capital is zeroed in analysis and scoring. Each mitigation in `mitigations[]` has a `type` (`'delay' | 'valueRange' | 'relativeValue' | 'other'`). The `'other'` type supports an optional `label?: string` (1-2 words) shown in badges instead of the truncated description — the full description appears on hover. Each mitigation can have `scopedTo?: { address: string, type: 'admin' | 'dependency' }` to limit it to a specific caller — mitigations without `scopedTo` are global. Each mitigation can have `impactCap?: ImpactCap` — unified `{ value, unit, multiplier? }` where `value` is hardcoded-amount or fieldRef, `unit` is `usd`/`scaler`/`token` (token pulls price+decimals from `funds-data.json`), and `multiplier` is an optional decimal (default 1). In `unit: token` mode, hardcoded amounts are whole tokens, fieldRef amounts are raw on-chain units. Resolved to `impactCapUsd` by `getMitigationsForOwner()`; capital analysis applies caps via `effectiveCapUsd`. Legacy shapes accepted via `normalizeImpactCap()`. Full schema + examples in `docs/developers/features/permissions.md`. **Mitigation dedup + entity-level aggregation.** Two helpers in `pages/review/views/explorer/shared.tsx`: (1) `mitigationDedupKey(m)` — the canonical visible-identity key. Mirrors what `MitigationBadge` actually renders: `label:<label>` if a label exists, otherwise `delay:<seconds>` / `valueRange:<min>:<max>:<unit>` / `relativeValue:<maxChangePercent>` / `other:<description>`. **`scopedTo` is intentionally excluded** — scope only shows in the tooltip, never on the badge, so two mitigations scoped to different admins now collapse to one badge if their visible identity matches (e.g. two `delay: 86400s` mitigations scoped to different admins). (2) `aggregateMitigationsByImpact(functions)` — the canonical entity-level utility used wherever badges aggregate across an admin or dependency's functions (`AdminCards`, `AdminsSection`, `DependencyCards`, `DependenciesSection`, `MitigationsSummary`). Computes each function's TVS impact (`directFundsUsd + directTokenValueUsd + Σ min(rc.usd, rc.effectiveCapUsd)` over `fundsAtRisk` reachable contracts), drops mitigations whose every source function has $0 TVS impact, dedupes the survivors with `mitigationDedupKey`, and sorts by descending max source-function impact. The plain `deduplicateMitigations()` (same key, no impact filter) is kept for the few non-aggregated call sites. Mitigation resolution is centralized in `projectAnalysis.ts` `getMitigationsForOwner()` — computes direct mitigations (filtered by owner) plus transitive mitigations (collected via forward BFS through call graph, including global and scoped mitigations from downstream functions). `reviewCompiler.ts` uses the result directly (`f.mitigations`), it does NOT compute mitigations. Full schema in `docs/developers/features/permissions.md`.

**Owner Path Format**: `<contractRef>.<valuePath>` where contractRef is `$self`, `@fieldName`, or `eth:0xAddress`. Examples:
- `{ "path": "$self.owner" }` - owner field in current contract
- `{ "path": "@governor.signers[0]" }` - follow governor field, get first signer
- `{ "path": "$self.accessControl.DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE.members" }` - AccessControl role members

Full path reference with all examples in `docs/developers/features/permissions.md`.

**Contract Tags** (`contract-tags.json`): Array of `{ contractAddress, isExternal, isGovernance, entity, fetchBalances, fetchPositions, isToken, fetchAggregate, aggregateHandler, aggregateLabel, timestamp }`. Full schema in `docs/developers/features/infrastructure.md`.


### Panel Development

To add new panels:

1. Add panel ID to `PANEL_IDS` in `store.ts`
2. Register component in `PANELS` and `READONLY_PANELS` in `ProjectPage.tsx`
3. Create panel component in `/defidisco/` folder following existing patterns
4. Import and register in `ProjectPage.tsx` with single line addition

EIDs auto-enumerated from PeerSet events. Handler type: `layerZeroOAppConfig`, config: `{ endpoint, includeEnforcedOptions?, includeRateLimits?, extraEids? }`
│   ├── MetaMorphoCapHandler.ts           # Reads MetaMorpho per-market supply caps off the vault's `config(bytes32)` mapping. Two modes: `market` returns the cap of a single market (config: `marketId`); `feed` walks `supplyQueue`, calls `idToMarketParams` on Morpho Blue to fetch each market's oracle adapter, scans the adapter's `BASE_FEED_1/2` and `QUOTE_FEED_1/2` for a Chainlink feed match, and sums the matching markets' caps (config: `feed`, optional `morphoAddressField` default `MORPHO`, optional `queueField` default `supplyQueue`). Handler type: `metaMorphoCap`
│   ├── GhoBucketCapacityHandler.ts       # Reads a GHO facilitator's bucket capacity from the GhoToken's `getFacilitator(address)` tuple return; stores tuple element 0 (bucketCapacity) as a single uint128 field on the facilitator's discovered entry. Used as a live `fieldRef` source for `impactCap` mitigations on GhoDirectMinter / GhoDirectFacilitator mint paths. Handler type: `ghoBucketCapacity`, config: `{ ghoToken }`
│   └── AaveMarketAggregateTvsHandler.ts  # Aggregates an Aave V3 market's USD TVS in one field. Configured on the PoolAddressesProvider: walks `Pool.getReservesList()`, fetches each reserve's `aTokenAddress` via `getReserveData`, multiplies `aToken.totalSupply()` by `AaveOracle.getAssetPrice(asset)` and divides by `10^decimals × BASE_CURRENCY_UNIT`, sums into a single integer USD value. Used as a live `fieldRef` source for `impactCap` mitigations on PoolConfigurator pause / oracle / token-upgrade functions. Handler type: `aaveMarketAggregateTvs`, config: `{ aTokenNameFilter?, priceOracleField? (default getPriceOracle), poolField? (default getPool), balanceOfAddress? (when set, sums `aToken.balanceOf(holder)` × price instead of `totalSupply`, e.g. for the Aave Collector treasury) }`

## Code Review Guidelines

### Formatting and Linting Rules

**CRITICAL: Reject PRs with formatting-only changes outside `/defidisco/` folders**

This repository is a fork of L2BEAT. To maintain easy upstream merges:

1. **DO NOT accept PRs that reformat L2BEAT code** - Changes to files outside `/defidisco/` folders should only contain functional changes, not formatting fixes
2. **Formatting is only allowed in DeFiDisco folders**:
   - `packages/protocolbeat/src/apps/discovery/defidisco/`
   - `packages/l2b/src/implementations/discovery-ui/defidisco/`
   - `packages/discovery/src/discovery/handlers/defidisco/`
3. **If a PR contains formatting changes to upstream files**, request that the author revert those changes before approval
4. Use the SKILL /lint to perform the right formatting.

### Documentation Requirements

**PRs that add or change features must include documentation updates:**

1. **CLAUDE.md** — Update the Feature Index if adding a new feature; update Development Guidelines if changing conventions or data access patterns
2. **`docs/developers/features/<relevant>.md`** — Update the relevant feature doc with new function names, file paths, data structures, or design decisions
3. **`docs/researchers/getting-started.md`** — If the feature affects the researcher workflow, add or update the relevant section
4. **`docs/developers/architecture.md`** — If the feature changes backend data flow or system architecture, update the relevant subsection
5. **Request changes** on PRs that introduce new features without corresponding documentation
