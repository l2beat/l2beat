// NOTE(radomski): The entire permission network is modeled as a graph. The
// graph contains nodes and edges. Nodes are contracts and edges are "actions"
// that contracts can perform on each other. Types of actions that can be
// performed are defined by the type Permission.
//
// Each node contains threshold which is redundant for contracts that are not
// multisigs, but it makes the processing easier to set it to one for
// non-multisig contracts. It also contains a delay field which allows to model
// things like multisigs with delays or contracts which always execute an
// operation with some additional baseline delay.
//
// Edges link two nodes together and define the action that can take place on
// that link. Each action can have a execution delay which is additive to the
// node on which that action can take place.
//
// Multisigs are modeled as a link between the multisig and the owner with the
// permission type set to 'member'. This is really powerful but as always with
// great power comes great responsibility and setting the delays on the edge
// level for multisig members can introduce a lot of potential confusion when
// these delays will start to drift apart. Current implementation does not say
// what to do in a scenario when one members has a smaller delay than others
// and such a case should be discussed.
