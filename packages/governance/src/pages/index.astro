          <p>
            We recognize that achieving successful decentralized governance
            stands as a vital challenge within the blockchain realm. Our goal is
            to actively contribute to governance across the Ethereum ecosystem,
            ensuring that L2 solutions evolve towards a more secure,
            decentralized, and trustworthy future.
          </p>
          <p>
            For us, governance isn't just about casting a vote. The real magic
            happens during healthy debates and coming to conclusions together.
            Voting should just be the cherry on top of a great community-driven
            process.

              Transparency & Open Communication: We believe in being open about
              our decision-making process and keeping the community informed
              about any proposals or issues we discuss.
            </li>
            <li>
              Community Focus: Our top priority is to always consider the

            <li>
              Inclusiveness: We're committed to fostering a diverse and

          <p>
            At L2BEAT we believe that crypto is the new infrastructure for the
            future financial system. As such, we believe that in order for it to
            be successful, it needs to be:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>
              Permissionless, no one should need a third party's permission to
              join the network,
            </li>
            <li>
              Censorship resistant, everyone should be free from arbitrary
              censorship,
            </li>
            <li>
              Trustless, it's all about cryptographic proofs and consensus, not
              trusting a central party,
            </li>
            <li>
              Decentralized, power and control should be spread across many
              participants,
            </li>
            <li>
              Transparent, everyone should be able to verify and account for
              transactions, even if they're private,
            </li>
            <li>
              Secure and safe, user safety and security come first, not relying
              on anyone acting honestly,
            </li>
            <li>
              Open-source, we live by "don't trust, verify," so if we can't see
              the code, we can't trust it.
            </li>

            To promote transparency and communication as delegates, we’re
            hosting recurring Office Hours on Google Meets.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            During the Office Hours, anyone is able to reach L2BEAT’s governance
            team, which consists of Kaereste (Krzysztof Urbanski) and Sinkas
            (Anastassis Oikonomopoulos) and discuss our activity as delegates.
            To allow enough time for constructive discussion, each Office Hours
            call is specifically targeted at one of the protocols we’re
            delegates in. However, if time allows, we’ll also be available to
            address things relative to the other protocols.
