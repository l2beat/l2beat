/**
 * Manually verified contracts
 * In case a contract is not verified on Etherscan, but is verified by other means, it can be added here.
 *
 * NOTE: If any entry is added/removed from this file:
 *  On adding a new entry, run `yarn check-verified-contracts` to ensure the new entry is added to the verified contracts list.
 *  On removing an entry, please manually remove the entry from the verified contracts list (packages/config/src/verified.json) and run `yarn check-verified-contracts` again.
