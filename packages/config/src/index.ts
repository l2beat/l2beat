/**
 * IMPORTANT! PLEASE READ
 *
 * In an effort to streamline working with config all current non-type
 * exports are explicitly stated in this file. The aim is to reduce non-type
 * exports to the absolute minimum.
 *
 * Ideally this file would look like this:
 *
 * ```ts
 * export { ProjectService } from './projects'
 * export type * from './types'
 * ```
 *
 * As you can see it'll take us a while to get there. In the meantime
 * DO NOT ADD NEW NON-TYPE EXPORTS to @l2beat/config. Thanks!
