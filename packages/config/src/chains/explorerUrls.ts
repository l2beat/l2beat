// NOTE(radomski): This should be removed. It's only here because config is in
// a transitional period where the way it works is not yet where we would want
// it to be. In ProjectDiscovery we need to have access to the url of the
// explorer for different chains but we can't access layer2s/layer3s/bridges
// since entries of these arrays are being built by ProjectDiscovery.
//
// The ideal solution that config will employ is a three pass approach.
//
// - The first pass reads in the data required for operation.
// - The second pass builds each project
// - The third pass links up projects between each other, e.g. DA Bridges used
// by projects.
//
// In the third pass we'll understand what projects are available and we can
// inline the explorer url at that time.
