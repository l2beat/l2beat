## Description

add ethereal on ethereal disco incl the exchange contract. heavily EOA and layerzero-governed.

this is the first orbit stack that uses the native OFT integration (uses a precompile to allow gas token mints on the L2).

for TVS we are counting the wrapped USDe for now (covers >90% since the exchange only supports this token). in the future we will need a custom tvs adapter for such chains.

## Config/verification related changes

Following changes come from updates made to the config file,
or/and contracts becoming verified, not from differences found during

## Description

standard v41 (wasmroot) orbit stack with custom outbox that can sweep native tokens from the escrow.

the wasmroot is not yet resolved because that would require global disco refresh.
