      description: `
      This is a standard Token Bridge that locks tokens in the escrow contract on Ethereum and mints tokens on Sonic. Permissioned relayers need to periodically update the state root in the StateOracle on both sides of the bridge. Referencing the latest state root, a user can then prove their deposit at the destination bridge contract using a merkle proof and receive their tokens. Each state root update must be signed by at least ${validatorThresholdString} validators. The permissioned validator set can be changed with each state update as long as it is signed by ${validatorThresholdString} of the current validator set.
      
      
      For the special case of the S token (gas token on Sonic), there is an adapter contract on the Sonic side that escrows S and unlocks the tokens for incoming bridge transactions. The FTM token on the Ethereum side is mapped to the S token on Sonic, which means the token gets 'converted' when bridged in either direction. Since new S or FTM cannot be minted by the bridge, there is a limit to how much can be bridged either way. For other supported tokens, this is not the case because they can be minted on Sonic.
      
      
      State updates are expected regularly (currently every ${heartBeatInterval} Sonic blocks) and can be fast-tracked by paying a fee of ${fastLaneFee} ETH. The state updates are not enforced and only Relayers are permitted to update. The bridge has a liveness self-check that sets the bridge status to 'dead' after a predefined period of ${timeUntilDeadString} in which no new state updates have arrived. In the 'dead' state, users can re-claim their deposits on the source chain side and withdraw based on the latest available state root on the destination chain side.`,
