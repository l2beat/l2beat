    detailedDescription:
      'Token Gateway is secured from even the most malicious byzantine attacks by Hyperbridge. With over $2 billion lost due to vulnerabilities in traditional multisig bridges, itâ€™s clear the industry needs a new approach. Token Gateway prioritizes security above all, offering a safer, trust-free approach to token bridging. It maintains a ledger of all tokens bridged across chains ensuring malicious chains can\'t withdraw more than they deposit. Token Gateway disintermediates solvers, fillers and market makers ensuring users always get 100% of their assets with no liquidity or slippage fees',
