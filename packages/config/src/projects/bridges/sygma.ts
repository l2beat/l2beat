      'Sygma is a an interoperability protocol enabling asset transfers, non-fungible tokens, and cross-chain execution. With Sygma, developers can extend their applications across Ethereum mainnet, Base, Cronos, Polygon, Gnosis, Polkadot, Kusama, and other Substrate-based chains with active work on Bitcoin and Cosmos SDK interoperability.',
    detailedDescription: `Sygma in its current version is an interoperability protocol relying, from the Ethereum's point-of-view, on a \
    single EOA address' signature. This address is meant to represent MPC validators. There are plans in the future to extend the protocol and \
    add zk verifiers for block header oracle verification and optimistic routes that can be tailored to users' needs, however at the moment these capabilities are not deployed.`,

On each deposit event or cross-chain message, the trusted relayers on the Sygma protocol perform an MPC ceremony utilizing threshold signature signing (TSS) to jointly attest to the validity of the cross-chain message prior to execution. Although entry-level, an MPC relayer architecture represents a significant increase in security versus traditional multisig bridges, ensuring that no single participant can defeat an honest majority. The current Sygma relayer network consists of a set of federated entities including Bware Labs, Phala Network, ChainSafe Systems, and Sygma Labs. It is worth noting that this offchain setup cannot be verified on Ethereum and has to be trusted.',
