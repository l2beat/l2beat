      description: `Immutable zkEVM bridge makes use of Axelar network to transfer assets between Ethereum and Immutable zkEVM. A deposit starts by a user depositing tokens on the Bridge contract and then the tokens are minted on the destination chain.

Withdrawals to Ethereum can be delayed by a predefined time with a flow rate mechanism that controls outflows of the bridge escrow. The ProxyAdmin or an address with the rate_control role can define so-called buckets for each token: Each bucket has a capacity and a refill rate. All withdrawals that exceed the tokens bucket capacity trigger the withdrawal queue, which delays subsequent withdrawals of *any* of the bridges' assets for a time defined in withdrawalDelay (currently ${formatSeconds(
        discovery.getContractValue('Bridge', 'withdrawalDelay'),
