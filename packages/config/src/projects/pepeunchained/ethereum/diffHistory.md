## Description

Field .issuedPermissions is removed from the output as no longer needed. Added 'permissionsConfigHash' due to refactoring of the modelling process (into a separate command).

## Config/verification related changes

Following changes come from updates made to the config file,
or/and contracts becoming verified, not from differences found during
discovery. Values are for block 22244001 (main branch discovery), not current.

OptimismMintableERC20 is a standard extension of the base ERC20 token contract designed to allow the L1StandardBridge contracts to mint and burn tokens. This makes it possible to use an OptimismMintablERC20 as this chain's representation of a token on the host chain, or vice-versa.
