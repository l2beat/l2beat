## Description

Field .issuedPermissions is removed from the output as no longer needed. Added 'permissionsConfigHash' due to refactoring of the modelling process (into a separate command).

## Config/verification related changes

Following changes come from updates made to the config file,
or/and contracts becoming verified, not from differences found during
discovery. Values are for block 22208467 (main branch discovery), not current.

## Description

Config related: add guardian description details, hide some noisy values, hide AddressManager as spam cat, add proposer / challenger to permissioned opfp chains.

## Config/verification related changes

Following changes come from updates made to the config file,
or/and contracts becoming verified, not from differences found during
discovery. Values are for block 22131469 (main branch discovery), not current.
