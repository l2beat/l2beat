## Description

07-23: Upgrade OptimismPortal2 again to change the finality delays ([no code changes](https://disco.l2beat.com/diff/eth:0xB443Da3e07052204A02d630a8933dAc05a0d6fB4/eth:0xB250566074B3c0f1B109A531A83f3d9B1a579273)). 
- proofMaturityDelaySeconds: 7d->1d
- disputeGameFinalityDelaySeconds: 3.5d->1d 

Upgrade to standard OP stack v3 contracts (OptiPortal2) with [KAILUA Hybrid mode](https://risc0.github.io/kailua/design.html) as respected dispute game. Kailua is configured in [Vanguard mode](https://risc0.github.io/kailua/parameters.html?highlight=vanguard#vanguard-advantage).

summary:
- standard op stack contracts
- standard op stack DisputeGameFactory with **custom** game1337 dispute game implementation
- state validation: hybrid optimistic + zk proven proposal tree:
  - a proposal must include a bond and a blob with intermediate state roots (3600)
  - any new proposal under the same parent state root implicitly challenges its siblings
    - but to eliminate siblings, such a new proposer needs to actively prove something after making their proposal (since the older siblings would win by their challenge window expiring first)
  - how to compete against siblings:
    1. MAX_CLOCK_DURATION on a node (KailuaGame) expires without a fault proof or sibling's validity proof = node optimistically wins against all siblings
    2. a validity proof over the entire range (3600*6 blocks) of a proposal can be zk-proven at any stage, immediately winning the game (**eliminating all siblings**)
    3. a 'fault proof' **eliminates a single sibling**: proves that a single intermediary state transition (6 blocks) in an opponents proposal results in a different (proven) state root than they committed to
  - vanguard mode:
    - first child proposal (to progress the state) can only be made by the vanguard address for `vanguardAdvantage` period (30d)
      - `proveOutputFault()` and `proveValidity()` are always permissionless during that time (a vanguard's proposal can be (in)validated))
      - siblings can be created as soon as the vanguard has proposed the first, meaning the vanguard only has the 'optimistic' advantage, giving the 'burden of proof' to other actors
  - DISPUTE_GAME_FINALITY_DELAY_SECONDS (execution delay) = 3.5d
    - for everyone incl vanguard this delays finalization of a winning (resolved) state root (for example to have time to blacklist the winning dispute game by the guardian)

- moved TimelockController of the RiscZeroVerifierRouter to standard template ([diff](https://disco.l2beat.com/diff/eth:0x45828180bbE489350D621d002968A0585406d487/eth:0x0b144E07A0826182B6b59788c34b32Bfa86Fb711)): 3d delay, EOA-controlled
- superchainconfigFake: added v1.2.0 template (same code as opstack superchainconf, different gov addresses): https://disco.l2beat.com/diff/eth:0x4da82a327773965b8d4D85Fa3dB8249b387458E7/eth:0x4da82a327773965b8d4D85Fa3dB8249b387458E7
