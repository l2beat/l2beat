Config related: add guardian description details, hide some noisy values, hide AddressManager as spam cat, add proposer / challenger to permissioned opfp chains.

## Description

Discovery rerun on the same block number with only config-related changes.

## Config/verification related changes

Following changes come from updates made to the config file,
or/and contracts becoming verified, not from differences found during

- current block number: 21222656

## Description

OP stack in alt-DA mode, not using EigenDA currently (judging from the DA-service byte in the tx data commitments). Thus BasementDA with DA challenges. Challenges must be respected in the L2 node's derivation rule, which is not clear here, but we assume they use the standard node like xterio, redstone, cyber.
