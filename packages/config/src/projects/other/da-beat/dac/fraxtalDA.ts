    ## Architecture
    FraxtalDA is a custom data availability solution built by the Fraxtal team. 
    The data is posted by the OP batcher to three separate locations: AWS, IPFS, and Cloudfare R2. 
    The IPFS hash is then submitted to the on-chain inbox contract on Ethereum.
    FraxtalDA relies on a single DA endpoint to manage data posting between the three different locations.

    The sequencer attests to data availability by posting an IPFS hash to an on-chain inbox contract on Ethereum. L2 nodes derive the L2 chain from the L1 by reading transactions commitments from this sequencer inbox.
        When reading from the inbox, the op-node verifies that the commitment hash is a valid IPFS CID. If the data corresponding to the hash is missing from IPFS, the op-node will halt, preventing further derivation of the L2 chain.
