Validators cannot be in more than one challenge at the same time, meaning that the protocol operates with [partial concurrency](https://medium.com/l2beat/fraud-proof-wars-b0cb4d0f452a). Since each challenge lasts 6d 8h, this implies that the protocol can be subject to [delay attacks](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/solutions-to-delay-attacks-on-rollups-434f9d05a07a), where a malicious actor can delay withdrawals as long as they are willing to pay the cost of losing their stakes. If the protocol is delayed attacked, the new stake requirement increases exponentially for each challenge period of delay. Challenges are played via a bisection game, where asserter and challenger play together to find the first instruction of disagreement. Such instruction is then executed onchain in the WASM OneStepProver contract to determine the winner, who then gets half of the stake of the loser. As said before, a state root is rejected only when no one left is staked on it. The protocol does not enforces valid bisections, meaning that actors can propose correct initial claim and then provide incorrect midpoints.","references":[{"text":"Fraud Proof Wars: Arbitrum Classic","href":"https://medium.com/l2beat/fraud-proof-wars-b0cb4d0f452a"}]}]},"milestones":[{"name":"Mainnet Beta launch","link":"https://blog.everclear.org/everclears-mainnet-is-live-24dedd572d56?gi=2c5d29c1443a","date":"2024-09-18T00:00:00Z","description":"Everclear Hub, the first Clearing Layer, is Live on Mainnet Beta.","type":"general"}],"badges":["Gelato","DAC","Orbit","EVM"],"display":{"stateValidationImage":"orbit","warning":"Fraud proof system is fully deployed but is not yet permissionless as it requires Validators to be whitelisted.","name":"Everclear Hub","slug":"everclear","redWarning":"Critical contracts can be upgraded by an EOA which could result in the loss of all funds.","description":"Everclear Hub is an AnyTrust Optimium on Ethereum, built on the Orbit stack.
