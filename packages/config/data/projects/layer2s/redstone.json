If a DA challenger finds that the data behind a tx data commitment is not available, they can submit a challenge which requires locking a bond within 12h. A challenge can be resolved by publishing the preimage data within an additional 12h. In such case, a portion of the challenger bond is burned, with the exact amount estimated as the cost incurred by the resolver to publish the full data, meaning that the resolver and challenger will approximately lose the same amount of funds. The system is not secure if the malicious sequencer is able to outspend the altruistic challengers. If instead, after a challenge, the preimage data is not published, the chain reorgs to the last fully derivable state.","references":[{"text":"OP Plasma specification","href":"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/blob/main/specs/experimental/alt-da.md"},{"text":"Universal Plasma and DA Challenges - Ethresear.ch","href":"https://ethresear.ch/t/universal-plasma-and-da-challenges/18629"},{"text":"Derivation: Batch submission - OP Mainnet specs","href":"https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/blob/main/specs/protocol/derivation.md#batch-submission"},{"text":"BatchInbox - Etherscan address","href":"https://etherscan.io/address/0xff00000000000000000000000000000000000690"},{"text":"OptimismPortal.sol - Etherscan source code, depositTransaction function","href":"https://etherscan.io/address/0xD0e1065F2A941Dd723F800C34D2D4282C3158A00#code"}],"risks":[{"category":"Funds can be stolen if","text":"the sequencer is malicious and is able to economically outspend the altruistic challengers."},{"category":"Funds can be stolen if","text":"there is no challenger willing to challenge unavailable data commitments."}]},"operator":{"name":"The system has a centralized operator","description":"The operator is the only entity that can propose blocks.
