Validators cannot be in more than one challenge at the same time, meaning that the protocol operates with [partial concurrency](https://medium.com/l2beat/fraud-proof-wars-b0cb4d0f452a). Since each challenge lasts 6d 8h, this implies that the protocol can be subject to [delay attacks](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/solutions-to-delay-attacks-on-rollups-434f9d05a07a), where a malicious actor can delay withdrawals as long as they are willing to pay the cost of losing their stakes. If the protocol is delayed attacked, the new stake requirement increases exponentially for each challenge period of delay. Challenges are played via a bisection game, where asserter and challenger play together to find the first instruction of disagreement. Such instruction is then executed onchain in the WASM OneStepProver contract to determine the winner, who then gets half of the stake of the loser. As said before, a state root is rejected only when no one left is staked on it. The protocol does not enforces valid bisections, meaning that actors can propose correct initial claim and then provide incorrect midpoints.","references":[{"text":"Fraud Proof Wars: Arbitrum Classic","href":"https://medium.com/l2beat/fraud-proof-wars-b0cb4d0f452a"}]}]},"milestones":[{"name":"Re.al Mainnet Launch","link":"https://mirror.xyz/0xBE105a62f39a2E0b09772C49E3EcF6ef21BEd85C/FL4Ewx3CKsFEfMFsU7DZ-cIdhZc05aChfASQ1t-SQ-A","date":"2024-05-15T00:00:00Z","description":"Re.al launches its mainnet with some initial dapps deployed.","type":"general"},{"name":"Arcana Launch","link":"https://mirror.xyz/0xBE105a62f39a2E0b09772C49E3EcF6ef21BEd85C/t3MsS-cCeJJD4ljXgQef3U01t564VL2h_au6iM6rBk4","date":"2024-05-15T00:00:00Z","description":"Arcana launches their platform for rebasing, delta-neutral yields on re.al.","type":"general"},{"name":"RWA Token Launch","link":"https://mirror.xyz/0xBE105a62f39a2E0b09772C49E3EcF6ef21BEd85C/eUmaidSfGSsjKKzepfyus6YSMog_FRdAQ6q5bsRoF7Y","date":"2024-05-15T00:00:00Z","description":"Re.al launches the RWA token and its governance protocol.","type":"general"}],"badges":["DAC","Gelato","Orbit","EVM"],"display":{"stateValidationImage":"orbit","warning":"Fraud proof system is fully deployed but is not yet permissionless as it requires Validators to be whitelisted.","name":"Re.al","slug":"real","description":"Re.al is an Arbitrum Orbit stack L2 with AnyTrust data availability, focusing on Real World Assets.","purposes":["RWA","Universal"],"links":{"websites":["https://re.al"],"apps":["https://re.al/bridge/","https://re.al/app/bridge/"],"documentation":["https://docs.re.al/"],"explorers":["https://explorer.re.al"],"repositories":["https://github.com/re-al-Foundation"],"socialMedia":["https://x.com/real_rwa","https://discord.gg/cKCCCFXvWj","https://mirror.xyz/0xBE105a62f39a2E0b09772C49E3EcF6ef21BEd85C"]},"activityDataSource":"Blockchain RPC","provider":"Arbitrum","category":"Optimium","finality":{"finalizationPeriod":549816}},"stage":{"stage":"NotApplicable"},"dataAvailability":{"layer":{"value":"DAC","sentiment":"warning","description":"The data is posted off chain and a Data Availability Committee (DAC) is responsible for protecting and supplying it."},"bridge":{"value":"1/2 DAC Members","sentiment":"bad","description":"There is a threshold of 1/2 members that must sign and attest that the data is correct and available."},"mode":"Transaction data (compressed)"},"riskView":{"stateValidation":{"value":"Fraud proofs (INT)","description":"No actor outside of the single Proposer can submit fraud proofs.
