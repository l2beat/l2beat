If the protocol is delayed attacked, the new stake requirement increases exponentially for each challenge period of delay. Challenges are played via a bisection game, where asserter and challenger play together to find the first instruction of disagreement. Such instruction is then executed onchain in the WASM OneStepProver contract to determine the winner, who then gets half of the stake of the loser.

This permission is governed by the Arbitrum Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) \n  and their elected Security Council. The Arbitrum DAO controls Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova through upgrades and modifications to their smart contracts on Layer 1 Ethereum and the Layer 2s. \n  While the DAO governs through token-weighted governance in their associated ARB token, the Security Council can directly act through \n  the Security Council smart contracts on all three chains. Although these multisigs are technically separate and connect to different target permissions, \n  their member- and threshold configuration is kept in sync by a manager contract on Arbitrum One and crosschain transactions.\n  \n  \n  Regular upgrades, Admin- and Owner actions originate from either the Arbitrum DAO or the non-emergency (proposer-) Security Council on Arbitrum One \n  and pass through multiple delays and timelocks before being executed at their destination. Contrarily, the three Emergency Security Council multisigs \n  (one on each chain: Arbitrum One, Ethereum, Arbitrum Nova) can skip delays and directly access all admin- and upgrade functions of all smart contracts. \n  These two general paths have the same destination: the respective UpgradeExecutor smart contract.\n  \n  \n  Regular upgrades are scheduled in the L2 Timelock. The proposer Security Council can do this directly and the Arbitrum DAO (ARB token holders and delegates) must meet a \n  CoreGovernor-enforced 5% threshold of the votable tokens. The L2 Timelock queues the transaction for a 3d delay and then sends it to the Outbox contract on Ethereum. This incurs another delay (the challenge period) of 6d 8h.\n  When that has passed, the L1 Timelock delays for additional 3d. Both timelocks serve as delays during which the transparent transaction contents can be audited, \n  and even cancelled by the Emergency Security Council. Finally, the transaction can be executed, calling Admin- or Owner functions of the respective destination smart contracts \n  through the UpgradeExecutor on Ethereum. If the predefined  transaction destination is Arbitrum One or -Nova, this last call is executed on L2 through the canonical bridge and the aliased address of the L1 Timelock.\n  \n  \n  Operator roles like the Sequencers and Validators are managed using the same paths. \n  Sequencer changes can be delegated to a Batch Poster Manager.\n  \n  \n  Transactions targeting the Arbitrum DAO Treasury can be scheduled in the 3d \n  Treasury Timelock by meeting a TreasuryGovernor-enforced 3% threshold of votable ARB tokens. The Security Council cannot regularly cancel \n  these transactions or schedule different ones but can overwrite them anyway by having full admin upgrade permissions for all the underlying smart contracts.","milestones":[{"name":"ArbOS 32 Emergency upgrade","link":"https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/releases/tag/v3.2.0","date":"2024-09-25T00:00:00Z","description":"SecurityCouncil emergency upgrades to fix attack vectors related to Stylus resource pricing.","type":"incident"},{"name":"ArbOS 31 Bianca upgrade","link":"https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/108288822474129076868455956066667369439381709547570289793612729242368710728616","date":"2024-09-03T00:00:00Z","description":"Arbitrum upgrades to ArbOS 31 activating Stylus (new languages for smart contracts).","type":"general"},{"name":"Arbitrum starts using blobs","link":"https://twitter.com/arbitrum/status/1768306107318178061","date":"2024-03-14T00:00:00Z","description":"Arbitrum starts publishing data to blobs.","type":"general"},{"name":"ARB token airdrop","link":"https://twitter.com/arbitrum/status/1638888588443111425","date":"2023-03-23T00:00:00Z","description":"ARB token launched as a governance token for Arbitrum DAO.","type":"general"},{"name":"Nitro Upgrade","link":"https://medium.com/offchainlabs/arbitrum-nitro-one-small-step-for-l2-one-giant-leap-for-ethereum-bc9108047450","date":"2022-08-31T00:00:00Z","description":"Upgrade is live, introducing new architecture, increased throughput and lower fees.","type":"general"},{"name":"Odyssey paused","link":"https://twitter.com/arbitrum/status/1542159109511847937","date":"2022-06-29T00:00:00Z","description":"Due of the heavy load being put on the chain, Odyssey program got paused.","type":"incident"},{"name":"Odyssey started","link":"https://twitter.com/arbitrum/status/1539292126105706496","date":"2022-06-21T00:00:00Z","description":"Incentives program to onboard new users has started.","type":"general"},{"name":"Mainnet for everyone","description":"Whitelist got removed, there are no restrictions on who can transact with the network.","link":"https://twitter.com/arbitrum/status/1432817424752128008","date":"2021-08-31T00:00:00Z","type":"general"}],"knowledgeNuggets":[{"title":"Arbitrum update boosts decentralization","url":"https://twitter.com/bkiepuszewski/status/1594754717330309120","thumbnail":"l2beat-03.jpg"},{"title":"Arbitrum is down... or is it?","url":"https://twitter.com/bkiepuszewski/status/1438445910191710211","thumbnail":"l2beat-04.jpg"}],"badges":["Nitro","EthereumBlobs","WasmVM","Governance","L3HostChain","EVM"],"display":{"stateValidationImage":"orbit","warning":"Fraud proof system is fully deployed but is not yet permissionless as it requires Validators to be whitelisted.","name":"Arbitrum One","slug":"arbitrum","description":"Arbitrum One is a general-purpose Optimistic Rollup built by Offchain Labs and governed by the Arbitrum DAO.","purposes":["Universal"],"links":{"websites":["https://arbitrum.io/","https://arbitrum.foundation/"],"apps":["https://bridge.arbitrum.io"],"documentation":["https://docs.arbitrum.io","https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/"],"explorers":["https://arbiscan.io","https://explorer.arbitrum.io/","https://arbitrum.l2scan.co/"],"repositories":["https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/docs","https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance","https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum","https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro","https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arb-os"],"socialMedia":["https://twitter.com/arbitrum","https://arbitrumfoundation.medium.com/","https://discord.gg/Arbitrum","https://youtube.com/@Arbitrum","https://t.me/arbitrum"],"rollupCodes":"https://rollup.codes/arbitrum-one"},"activityDataSource":"Blockchain RPC","liveness":{"warnings":{"stateUpdates":"Please note, for Optimistic rollups the state is not finalized until the challenge period passes."},"explanation":"Arbitrum One is an Optimistic rollup that posts transaction data to the L1.
