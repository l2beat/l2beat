Since each challenge lasts 6d, this implies that the protocol can be subject to [delay attacks](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/solutions-to-delay-attacks-on-rollups-434f9d05a07a), where a malicious actor can delay withdrawals as long as they are willing to pay the cost of losing their stakes. If the protocol is delayed attacked, the new stake requirement increases exponentially for each challenge period of delay. Challenges are played via a bisection game, where asserter and challenger play together to find the first instruction of disagreement. Such instruction is then executed onchain in the WASM OneStepProver contract to determine the winner, who then gets half of the stake of the loser. As said before, a state root is rejected only when no one left is staked on it. The protocol does not enforces valid bisections, meaning that actors can propose correct initial claim and then provide incorrect midpoints.","references":[{"text":"Fraud Proof Wars: Arbitrum Classic","href":"https://medium.com/l2beat/fraud-proof-wars-b0cb4d0f452a"}]}]},"milestones":[{"name":"ArbOS v20 upgrade","link":"https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-arbos-version-20-atlas/20957","date":"2024-04-10T00:00:00.00Z","description":"Introduces EIP-4844 data blobs for L1 data availability and Dencun-related opcodes on L2.","type":"general"},{"name":"Parallel Mainnet closed launch","link":"https://twitter.com/ParallelFi/status/1743048283684237574","date":"2024-01-05T00:00:00Z","description":"Parallel Mainnet is open for developers.","type":"general"}],"badges":["Orbit","EthereumCalldata","EVM"],"display":{"stateValidationImage":"orbit","warning":"Fraud proof system is fully deployed but is not yet permissionless as it requires Validators to be whitelisted.","name":"Parallel","slug":"parallel","redWarning":"Critical contracts can be upgraded by an EOA which could result in the loss of all funds.","description":"Parallel is an Ethereum L2 solution utilizing Arbitrum Nitro technology.","purposes":["Universal","DeFi"],"links":{"websites":["https://parallel.fi"],"apps":["https://parallel.fi/airdrop"],"documentation":["https://docs.parallel.fi/parallel-chain/overview"],"explorers":["https://explorerl2new-surprised-harlequin-bonobo-fvcy2k9oqh.t.conduit.xyz/"],"repositories":[],"socialMedia":["https://twitter.com/ParallelFi","https://discord.gg/rdjVz8zavF","https://t.me/parallelfi_community"]},"activityDataSource":"Blockchain RPC","provider":"Arbitrum","category":"Optimistic Rollup","finality":{"finalizationPeriod":518400},"liveness":{"warnings":{"stateUpdates":"Please note, for Optimistic rollups the state is not finalized until the challenge period passes."},"explanation":"Parallel is an Optimistic Rollup that posts transaction data to the L1.
