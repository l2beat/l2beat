Polygon zkEVM utilizes [PIL-STARK](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/pil-stark) as the main proving stack for their system. PIL-STARK is an implementation of the [eSTARK](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/474) protocol designed specifically to prove PIL specifications. eSTARK extends the STARK proof system to support eAIR, an intermediate representation that allows to succinctly express non-equality constraints. The circuits and the computations are represented using the PIL and zkASM custom languages. The scheme makes use of the Goldilocks field, which is much smaller than alt_bn128’s field.

The protocol makes use of recursive proof aggregation. Extensive documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zkevm-techdocs/blob/a6d46da98ad32ace544e5dbc31d34831f9cc1bdd/docs/proof-recursion/proof-recursion.pdf). The system doesn’t implement transaction data compression yet.

The final proof is wrapped into a fflonk proof. The CRS used is the powersOfTau28_hez_final that can be found [here](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs/blob/master/README.md). The instructions to regenerate the verification keys can be found [here](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zkevm-contracts/blob/main/verifyMainnetDeployment/verifyMainnetProofVerifier.md).

The differences between the zkEVM and the EVM are listed [here](https://docs.polygon.technology/tools/zkevm/architecture/protocol/etrog-upgrade/). The source code of the zkEVM can be found [here](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zkevm-rom).
