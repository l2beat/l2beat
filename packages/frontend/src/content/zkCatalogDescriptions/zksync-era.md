zkSync Era utilizes [Boojum](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-boojum/tree/main) as the main proving stack for their system. Boojum is an implementation of the [Redshift](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1400.pdf) protocol which uses the Plonk IOP with a polynomial commitment scheme based on List Polynomial Commitments (LPCs), which is in turn based on FRI, making the scheme transparent. The scheme makes use of the Goldilocks field, which is much smaller than alt_bn128â€™s field.

The protocol makes use of recursive proof aggregation via 15 [recursive circuits](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-zkevm_test_harness/blob/3cd647aa57fc2e1180bab53f7a3b61ec47502a46/circuit_definitions/src/circuit_definitions/recursion_layer/mod.rs#L29). At the moment of writing, there is no detailed documentation on the aggregation architecture. State diffs are published in [compressed form](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-era/blob/main/docs/specs/data_availability/pubdata.md) on L1.

The final proof is wrapped into a Plonk+KZG proof for cheap verification. The CRS used is the one generated by Aztec ceremony with 176 participations. The instructions to regenerate the verification keys can be found [here](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-era/tree/main/prover/vk_setup_data_generator_server_fri), with a documentation on their usage [here](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-era/blob/main/docs/guides/advanced/prover_keys.md).

Solidity contracts are compiled into Yul using `solc` and compiled again using `zksolc` to target a LLVM, which is then used to target the EraVM. The ISA spec of the EraVM can be found [here](https://matter-labs.github.io/eravm-spec/spec.html).  The differences between the zkEVM and the EVM are listed [here](https://docs.zksync.io/build/developer-reference/differences-with-ethereum.html). The source code of the circuits can be found [here](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-zkevm_circuits).
