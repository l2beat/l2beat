## **Optimism**


### **Season 8 Reflection Period Guide**

The Optimism Foundation [has published](https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-8-reflection-period-guide/10002) a guide that maps out the Season 8 Reflection Period and the two-stage voting calendar that follows. Between 12 – 18 June, token-holders are asked to read every Season 7 retrospective (DAB, Grants Council, Milestones & Metrics, ACC, Security Council) and think about changes they’d like to see. From June 19 to 25, Citizens can register to vote. Everyone should reread the Season 8 Intent. Delegates and citizens can post feedback or provide the four formal “ready to vote” approvals that Budget-Board and ACC amendments need to enter Special Voting Cycle #39a. That first vote window (26 June – 2 July) will lock in the DAO operating budget, ratify the Intent, and elect or amend any councils whose charters are ready. Self-nominations for all council seats will then open through July 14, with operating-budget drafts due by July 16. A second vote window (17–23 July) will elect council members, ratify their budgets, and allow missions to pass via optimistic approval. Season 8 formally launches on July 24, after which the new protocol upgrade flow (effective August 1) will govern all future changes.


### **Season 8 Council and Board Mandate Guidance**

The Foundation [has published](https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-8-council-and-board-mandate-guidance/10008) a “Season 8 Council & Board Mandate” guide that establishes a 12-month term for every elected body and outlines the deadlines for charters, budgets, and nominations. Charter amendments from would-be leads are due by 20 June (with four approvals by 25 June) and will be voted on from 26 June to 2 July; the winning charter writer automatically becomes the lead for Seasons 8 and 9. Elected leads must then post 12-month operating budgets by July 9, gather feedback, and secure approvals by July 16, ahead of a vote from July 17 to 23 that also elects all council and board members.. The new Budget Board is already set, while the Anti-Capture and Collective Feedback Commissions will sunset after Season 8 unless the DAO intervenes. All teams are instructed to automate where possible and design their work to shrink over time. Season 8 officially kicks off on 24 July.


### **Budget Board Advisory Proposal for the DAO Operating Budget for Seasons 8 and 9**

Danelund.eth [has created](https://gov.optimism.io/t/budget-board-advisory-proposal-for-the-dao-operating-budget-for-seasons-8-and-9/10013) a post outlining the new Budget Board's non-binding framework for Optimism’s next-year operating spend. It caps all council and board costs for Seasons 8-9 at 2.3 million OP—roughly 26% of the protocol’s trailing-twelve-month revenue—while keeping a one-time 80k OP pot for the Board’s own data tooling outside that ceiling. The figure is slightly above last season’s ratio, providing leads with an additional 0.8% “buffer” to test growth ideas or pay retroactive performance bonuses, while still leaving the Governance Fund with an estimated seven-year runway if mission funding remains flat. Long-term, the Board outlines a glide path that gradually reduces operating expenses to 12% of revenue within five years and encourages each team to allocate approximately 20% of its budget for outcome-based rewards. Councils will draft their budgets within the ceiling; the Board will review the results after Season 8 and adjust if six-month revenue trends warrant it. A separate missions budget is due 2 July, after which the whole package will go to a vote. Feedback on the draft closes 12 June before the Board finalizes its advice.


### **Season 8 Intent**

The Foundation [has posted](https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-8-intent/10009) the Season 8 Intent, setting a single, ecosystem-wide goal for the second half of 2025: to make protocol-native interoperability a reality and widely used across the Superchain. All Collective work—OP Labs engineering, Foundation growth initiatives, council grants, and Retro Funding missions—must serve three objectives: ship the interop upgrade, grow Superchain TVL, and drive developer adoption of interop features. Success is defined quantitatively: at least $100 million in cross-chain transfers per month, rising “interop-ready” TVL, and verified dev integrations. To achieve this, OP Labs will deliver message-passing, token bridging, sub-second blocks, Kona production, and revenue sharing, while the Foundation runs partnership campaigns and onboards more Stage 1 chains. Councils will fund TVL incentives, futarchy experiments, and technical audits; Retro Funding will reward Ethereum core devs, open-source tooling, and on-chain app builders. Delegates will ratify the intent and green-light three Governance-Fund missions, while Citizens will optimistically approve three Retro-Funding pools.


### **Guide to Season 8**

The Foundation [has published](https://gov.optimism.io/t/guide-to-season-8/10001) a “Guide to Season 8,” outlining how governance will operate from the July 24 kickoff through December 24. The document first salutes Season 7’s milestones—six protocol upgrades, the launch of the Budget Board, 14 OP Chains onboarded, and the debut of futarchy and success-metric grants—before pivoting to what’s next. Season 8’s theme is “purpose-built governance”: every structural tweak is designed to reduce platform risk for Superchain users. Councils and boards will now serve 12-month terms. Citizenship has been formally defined across chains, apps, and end-users, and a brand-new protocol upgrade flow will activate on August 1. All contributors will work toward a single Intent—shipping interoperability, growing Superchain TVL, and driving developer adoption—via tightly scoped Missions funded either by the Governance Fund or Retroactive PGF. The guide also flags key dates: Reflection Period tasks are now, Intent ratification and budget votes are scheduled for late June, council elections and operating-budget approvals are set for mid-July, and Season 8’s official start is on July 24.

### **Proposal: Extend AGV Council Term and Align Future Elections with Operational Cadence**

Arbitrum Gaming Ventures (AGV) [submitted a proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-extend-agv-council-term-and-align-future-elections-with-operational-cadence/29425) to the DAO, requesting that it retain its current Council in place through December 31, 2025, and transition all future elections to a single, calendar-year cycle. The Council argues that AGV is only now entering its first complete execution cycle—deploying capital, tracking studio milestones, and scaling the ops team—so a mid-2025 turnover would sap momentum just as deals are closing. Under the plan, every seat would be contested once a year: nominations each October, Snapshot voting in November, and a calm December hand-off that coincides with AGV’s slower season. Any mid-term resignation would be filled by a Council-chosen replacement, ratified by a quick DAO temp-check, and that appointee would serve only until the December reset to avoid staggered terms creeping back in. The proposal is non-constitutional, carries no extra cost, and is slated for a Snapshot vote on 19 June.

## **Uniswap**


### **[RFC] Etherlink Canonical Uniswap V3 Deployment**

Dtz_NL [has created](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-etherlink-canonical-uniswap-v3-deployment/25659) an RFC that outlines the canonical deployment for Etherlink, an EVM-compatible L2 built with Tezos roll-up technology, which has grown from $1.5M to $40 M in TVL since its launch. Because GFX Labs handled the deployment and Wormhole will bridge assets, no new on-chain work or DAO funding is required; the only step is to add Etherlink’s factory and ancillary addresses to the “v3-deployments.uniswap.eth” ENS record that the Accountability Committee maintains. Control of the new pools would remain under Ethereum L1 governance, just as with every other canonical rollout. The proposer, backed by the Tezos Foundation, positions Etherlink’s near-zero fees and Apple Farm incentive program as fertile ground for Uniswap liquidity, while stressing that the deployment is already live and simply awaits DAO ratification.

## **Polygon**


### **Sunsetting Polygon zkEVM Mainnet Beta in 2026**

Polygon Labs CEO Marc Boiron [announced](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/sunsetting-polygon-zkevm-mainnet-beta-in-2026/21020) that the Polygon zkEVM Mainnet Beta will be deprecated in 2026. Launched three years ago to showcase byte-code-level ZK-EVM equivalence, the chain struggled with persistent hurdles—slow EIP-4844 support, security-driven ZK counter frictions for DeFi, a custom client that complicated debugging, and no clear UX edge in an increasingly modular roll-up market. Development effectively stopped 18 months ago; the coming shutdown frees resources for higher-impact work, such as strengthening Polygon PoS and finishing the Agglayer. 

The sequencer will keep running for 12 months with forced exits permanently enabled so users can withdraw at any time, though Polygon warns less-savvy users to exit before the sequencer halts. Future EIPs won’t be back-ported and service-levels will drop, but transitional grants will help teams migrate code, assets, and liquidity—ideally to Polygon PoS. Boiron apologizes for the disruption, invites feedback on the wind-down, and reaffirms Polygon’s focus on nimble, differentiated L2 solutions.


### **Quadratic Accelerator S2 Impact Report**

0xJustice_qacc [has created an impact report](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/quadratic-accelerator-s2-impact-report/21022) about the Quadratic Accelerator’s second season (q/acc S2), bankrolled by Polygon. They put their “protocol-sponsored tokenization” model through a severe bear-market stress test, and still beat baseline quadratic-funding metrics. Four early-stage teams (To Da Moon, How to DAO, Gridlock wallet, and Web3 Packs) each received a $50k POL liquidity seed, then launched tokens via q/acc’s bonding-curve ICO; public buyers added a further 30% of the matching pool despite BTC &lt; $100k and ETH &lt; $2k. Web3 Packs drew over $20k, and To Da Moon attracted 500+ unique minters; most cohort tokens now hold $0.5-$ 0.7 million FDV and trade above their launch floor, giving early buyers 10-28% paper gains. Because q/acc allows users to swap any token on any chain, 65% of inflows came from rival ecosystems—effectively “vampire-attacking” them for POL. For Polygon, the $ 1.5 million POL grant has already grown to $ 1.7 million in AMM liquidity and generated $ 13.3 million in new token market caps—an ROI the report claims outperforms conventional grants. With half of all Q/Acc alumni now pushing toward $1 million caps, the team argues that the model is the cheapest way for chains to bootstrap small-to-midsize projects while giving communities real upside.

## **Starknet**


### **Proposal for StarkWare’s participation in Starknet staking mechanism during v2 - Feedback request**

Manor has [created a proposal](https://community.starknet.io/t/proposal-for-starkwares-participation-in-starknet-staking-mechanism-during-v2-feedback-request/115607) outlining how StarkWare wants to participate in the Starknet Staking mechanism during the v2  (July-December 2025) and is seeking community input to refine the plan. The company would delegate a fixed, equal amount of STRK to every validator that clears basic thresholds—KYC/KYB, ≥ 99% uptime, ≤ 10% commission, and later a V3 test-net track record—to widen the staking pool and give smaller operators a competitive edge. Allocations would be re-evaluated monthly, allowing new entrants or non-compliant nodes to be added or trimmed without requiring heavy intervention. In parallel, StarkWare would run one validator itself, hard-capped at 10% of the total stake and barred from outside delegations, to model best practices while keeping power diffuse. Because a bigger pool lowers per-token rewards under the current curve, StarkWare also floats a minor increase to the mint-rate constant “c” so yields stay steady as participation climbs. A two-week sign-up window ending 1 July is suggested for the first delegation “wave,” with an experimental, adaptive approach thereafter. Feedback is sought on the flat-allocation model, validator requirements, and the reward curve tweak before the plan is finalized.


### **Starknet Foundation: Introducing Polls**

The Starknet Foundation [plans](https://community.starknet.io/t/starknet-foundation-introducing-polls/115620) to conduct regular, non-binding polls to gauge the community’s sentiment on protocol- and product-level questions before formal proposals are drafted. Polls will be hosted on Snapshot Off-chain and may use various formats—such as multiple-choice, ranked-choice, or open comments—depending on the topic. Four “fixed” polling windows will close each year on the equinoxes and solstices (the first one this autumn), with ad-hoc polls added when necessary. For each window, the Foundation will collect questions from its own product teams and StarkWare core devs, finalize the list two weeks before close, and promote the poll with progressively heavier marketing pushes. Results will be discussed on the next delegate call and used to steer roadmap priorities, but they carry no formal governance weight. The team stresses that polling is purely informational and sits outside Starknet’s on-chain voting process.

### **Proposal Review Call June 18th**

Shelby [has opened](https://forum.zknation.io/t/proposal-review-call-june-18th/709) the forum thread for the next Proposal Review Call, scheduled for Wednesday, 18 June. Any author with an active or in-progress proposal can request a slot to present and gather delegate feedback; the final agenda will be posted the day of the meeting based on those requests. The draft agenda already lists three time-sensitive topics: the same-day token unlock for early investors and Machine Learning team members, an execution status update on ZIP-10 and ZIP-11 at Layer 1, and a rehearsal of the Guardian Veto process for Q2 2025. Questions or additional items should be added to the thread so they can be incorporated before the call.

## **Scroll**


### **Your Local Node is approved - What comes next?**

The Scroll Foundation [has published](https://forum.scroll.io/t/your-local-node-is-approved-what-comes-next/847) an Expectations Statement for newly-approved Local Nodes that spells out what running a node actually entails. Operators must align with Scroll’s values, pass KYC, and keep brand use strictly within the program; any outside use of logos requires written Foundation consent. A one-month “buffer” is granted to finalise execution plans, but operations should kick off by the first of the following month, with the Foundation helping on payments and KPI tracking via Karma GAP. Nodes are charged with boosting regional adoption: hosting events, funneling builders into the ecosystem, and constantly reporting local needs back to the DAO. Transparency is non-negotiable—monthly activity reports are mandatory for the next payout, quarterly reports must be posted publicly, and operators will join a dedicated governance call to discuss progress. Strong performers may win extra support, while laggards face remediation or sunset; a future Community Council will eventually take over evaluation duties from the Foundation.
