## **Optimism**

### **Internal Operating Procedures (IOP) for the Grants Council: Season 8**

Gonna.eth [posted](https://gov.optimism.io/t/internal-operating-procedures-iop-for-the-grants-council-season-8/10207/1) the Season 8 IOPs for the Grants Council, setting the playbook for how proposals are reviewed to drive interop-ready TVL and fees across the Superchain. Cycles run in three-week beats alongside governance, with applications open until the budget is almost tapped. A custom AI does first-pass scoring; GovNERDs can rescue good ideas that score low. Passing or promoted apps head to Final Review, where reviewers can pull in DAB context and approve by simple majority if funds remain. Ops keeps the workflow humming—status, sheets, reminders—while the Lead hosts office hours and breaks ties. Conflicts are disclosed and counted as abstentions toward quorum. Feedback lands on the forum, a report closes each cycle, and any IOP tweaks are recorded on-post and, unless urgent, start next cycle.


### **RetroPGF/RF Rounds 1-7: Uncovering the Trends in Participation, Categories & OP Allocation**

ARDev097 [posted](https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-rf-rounds-1-7-uncovering-the-trends-in-participation-categories-op-allocation/10208) a data-driven look from Lampros DAO at how RetroPGF/Retro Funding has shifted over seven rounds. Guest voters rotated in for R5–R7 with zero overlap, while a core of 17 badgeholders served in every round; participation peaked in R3–R4 and dipped in R7. Applications hit a high in R3 (643) and bounced back in R7 (567). R2, R5, and R6 funded all applicants; R7 had the most unfunded, pointing to tighter competition. On allocations, R3 led with 30M OP, R6 was leanest at 2.4M, and R7 granted 15.8M with a noticeable tilt toward larger awards, while R6 was the most even. In total, 1,168 unique projects have been funded, with Protocol Guild, Solidity, and ERC-4337 among the top recipients.

### **Establishing “Arbitrum Balkan” – A Regional Ecosystem & Policy Initiative**

0xRecruiter [posted](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/establishing-arbitrum-balkan-a-regional-ecosystem-policy-initiative/29742) a non-constitutional proposal to launch “Arbitrum Balkan,” a 12–24-month push across Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, and Greece to make Arbitrum the default L2 in the region. The plan blends policy engagement (MOUs, regulatory sandboxes aligned with MiCA), university partnerships, and a Stylus/Rust track, a cohort Builders League with bounties and demo days, an RWA & compliance lab, localized DevRel, and transparent on-chain grants. Delivery targets Arbitrum One/Nova and AnyTrust. The base ask is ~$2.5M (ARB-denominated) for year one—team/ops, grants, university programs, policy pilots, events/localization, and public data dashboards—with a stretch path to ~$4M if scope widens. Milestones include first MOUs and university tie-ups by month six, 100+ active builders by month twelve, and a public-sector pilot by month eighteen.


### **Introducing Curia AI: Your Onchain & Offchain Governance Assistant**

Curia [posted](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/looking-beta-testers-introducing-curia-ai-your-onchain-offchain-governance-assistant/29756) a call for beta testers for Curia AI, a governance assistant that stitches together forum threads, Snapshot, and on-chain proposals, and Tally profiles into one place so delegates can ask real questions and get sourced answers. The MVP ships deeper delegate lookups, sharper forum search, and cleaner links across platforms to follow decisions end-to-end.

## **Uniswap**


### **Uniswap Delegate Reward Initiative - Cycle 4**

Doo_StableLab [posted](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-delegate-reward-initiative-cycle-4/25764) an RFC for Cycle 4 of Uniswap’s delegate rewards, keeping the cohort at 15 and the budget steady while tightening incentives around real participation. Scoring still leans hardest on voting—heavier weight for on-chain—but adds more explicit authorship rules, a bonus for six months of perfect participation, and a new “skin-in-the-game” tweak: holding and self-delegating 1,000 UNI boosts both application points and payout eligibility. Selected delegates can earn up to $6k/month in UNI—half for maintaining ≥80% voting over the last three months, the rest tied to posting rationales, joining community calls, and meeting the 1,000-UNI bar. The ask is $540k in UNI for a six-month run, with the Accountability Committee handling distributions.

## **Polygon**


### **Council Transparency Report: PIP-67: Update Membership of the Protocol Council**

Mudit Gupta [posted](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/council-transparency-report-pip-67-update-membership-of-the-protocol-council/21196) a transparency report on behalf of the Polygon Protocol Council outlining signer changes under PIP-67. Justin Drake and Anthony Sassano step down with consent; Pablo Sabbatella (Opsek, Optimism SC) and Jack Sanford (Sherlock) take their seats. Polygon Labs Engineering and Polygon Labs Security also move from individual signers (Jordi Baylina, Mudit Gupta) to 3-of-5 multisigs to tighten ops and oversight. The refresh aligns with PIP-54/68’s push for a leaner, more decentralized upgrade path, passed with PC consensus at 7/13 (regular) and 10/13 (emergency).

## **Starknet**


### **Cairo 2.12.0 is out!**

FeedTheFed posted a release note for Cairo 2.12.0: it’s a compiler-only upgrade (Cairo→Sierra) you can use on testnet and mainnet right away, with much faster builds, snappier diagnostics, and new incremental caching in Scarb. The language server now fully supports procedural macros, fixing the lingering `#[test]` issue (use snforge_std ≥0.48.0), and there’s a dev tip to speed local loops with `inlining-strategy = "avoid"` in your Scarb dev profile. On the language side, this adds `let` chains and `let-else`, plus experimental declarative inline macros and “oracles” for piping external computations into `scarb execute`.

### **On-chain Market Making for CLEAR - Arrakis PALM migration to Arrakis PRO + TVL Topup**

Rapha Raffaelo [posted](https://forum.connext.network/t/on-chain-market-making-for-clear-arrakis-palm-migration-to-arrakis-pro-tvl-topup/1389) an RFC to migrate Everclear’s CLEAR/WETH market-making vault from Arrakis PALM to Arrakis PRO and add 7.5M CLEAR to deepen buy-side liquidity. Arrakis has run the Uniswap v3 1% pool since early this year, facilitating the vast majority of on-chain CLEAR volume; the PRO move readies the DAO for Uniswap v4, starting on a vanilla 0.85% pool and shifting to a dynamic-fee hook once live to cut LVR and arbitrage bleed. The pitch: tighter ranges, better capital efficiency, and future-proof strategy, with a one-click Safe migration (no downtime) and updated PRO dashboards after cutover.

### **ZKsync Guardians Funding 2024-2026**

ZKsync_Guardians [posted a draft](https://forum.zknation.io/t/tpp-x-zksync-guardians-funding-2024-2026/739) to fund the veto council for two years via a new capped minter. The plan revokes the undersized V1 minter and activates V2 with 8.5M ZK: 3.75M ZK for 2024–25 compensation, 3.75M ZK for 2025–26, plus 1M ZK for ops and legal. Compensation vests monthly and excludes team members of Matter Labs or other ZKsync entities. The parent minter is administered by the Token Assembly, with two child minters run by a Guardians 5/8 multisig and the Security Council as pauser. Guardians continue as values-aligned backstops—vetoing misaligned proposals and joining the Emergency Response Board—with the Token Assembly able to cancel minting and keep excess tokens unminted.


### **Proposal Review Call August 13**

Shelby [posted](https://forum.zknation.io/t/proposal-review-call-august-13/742) the thread for the next ZKsync Proposal Review call, inviting authors to book slots and noting the agenda will be finalized on the day of the call. Tentative topics include [TPP-6] Security Council v2 Funding (on-chain), [TPP-X] Guardians Funding 2024–2026 (forum), a segment with portport255 on Airbender and upcoming interop ZIPs (and what they mean for Prividium), plus a Trigger Mod walkthrough from Factory Labs (Matt & drnick).

## **Scroll**


### **Request for Proposals: DAO Treasury Management**

Eugene [opened an RFP](https://forum.scroll.io/t/request-for-proposals-dao-treasury-management/1047) for teams to help design and run Scroll’s treasury strategy—on-chain asset management, risk modeling, and the tooling and reporting to support it. Proposals should show fit with the DAO’s goals, relevant track record, approach, costs, and a willingness to work alongside other providers, with a clear public reporting cadence. Community asks include bear-market readiness, a stablecoin buffer for grants and vendors, plans for DVT and slashing insurance, and transparent operator sets with DAO-aligned runners; shortlisted teams may present on governance calls or pilot before selection.
