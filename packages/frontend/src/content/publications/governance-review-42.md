## **Optimism**

### **Allow the Optimism Foundation to Stake a Portion of Sequencer ETH Through Season 8**

The Optimism Foundation has [created a proposal](https://gov.optimism.io/t/allow-the-optimism-foundation-to-stake-a-portion-of-sequencer-eth-through-season-8/9710) to stake up to 60% of the Sequencer ETH (6,195 ETH) currently accruing to the Collective. This ETH is a share of the revenue generated by OP Stack chains across the Superchain (14,991 ETH to date, with 10,325 ETH held in the Collective Treasury). The plan outlines staking an initial 20% (~2,065 ETH) with BitGo for a 4.5% yield, net of fees, and later engaging two additional custodians—Kraken or Coinbase—to stake another 40% (2,065 ETH each). 

By approving this plan, the Collective would generate an estimated 243 ETH per year ($560k USD), while retaining ~40% of Sequencer ETH in idle reserves. This arrangement would remain in effect until Season 8 ends (December 2025), at which point it must be reauthorized.


### **Upgrade Proposal #13: OPCM and Incident Response Improvements**

Maurelian from OP Labs has introduced an [Upgrade Proposal](https://gov.optimism.io/t/upgrade-proposal-13-opcm-and-incident-response-improvements/9739) to improve L1 contract upgrades and incident response within the OP Stack. The plan features an OP Contracts Manager (OPCM) for orchestrating multi-chain upgrades, fault-proof system contract improvements, and a DeputyPauseModule that simplifies triggering a Superchain-wide pause if a major issue arises.

Under this proposal, upgrades to L1 contracts (including OptimismPortal, AnchorStateRegistry, and DelayedWETH) will streamline how withdrawals are proven, allow smaller/faster upgrades, and add new mechanisms for quickly handling emergencies. An important note: users with pending withdrawals at upgrade time may need to re-prove them. No node operator action is required, though OP Labs will communicate widely (via social channels, bridging providers, and developer support) before the scheduled mainnet upgrade on April 7, 2025. If a critical security concern surfaces beforehand, the upgrade can be canceled in coordination with the Security Council.


### **Proposal Preview: Operator Fee**

Leruaa has [created a post](https://gov.optimism.io/t/proposal-preview-operator-fee/9699) introducing a Proposal Preview titled “Operator Fee”, aiming to update the OP Stack fee mechanism so rollup operators can recover costs related to Alt-DA, ZK proving, or custom gas tokens. Currently, the parameter totalFee only covers execution (EIP-1559) and L1 Data Fee, which doesn’t accurately capture expenses for chains with different data availability strategies or advanced proof systems. The proposed solution adds operatorFeeScalar and operatorFeeConstant as parameters configured via SystemConfig on L1, plus an OperatorFeeVault to store these fees. This update is slated for inclusion in the Isthmus upgrade, giving OP Stack variants more flexibility in resource pricing without affecting existing chains that don’t need it.


### **Proposal Preview: Implement Prague features on the OP Stack**

Julian-coinbase has introduced a [Proposal Preview](https://gov.optimism.io/t/proposal-preview-implement-prague-features-on-the-op-stack/9703/1)—“Implement Prague features on the OP Stack”—to incorporate the upcoming Pectra Hardfork EIPs into the Isthmus upgrade for OP chains. The proposal aims for feature parity with Ethereum’s mainnet, which soon adopts Pectra changes such as BLS12-381 precompiles, historical block hashes, and EIP-7702 (set-code transactions). By aligning OP Stack upgrades with the L1 schedule, the network avoids a long latency period before users can access these new features.


### **Upgrade Proposal #12: L1 Pectra Readiness**

Geoknee from OP Labs has [created a proposal](https://gov.optimism.io/t/upgrade-proposal-12-l1-pectra-readiness/9706) to ensure OP Stack chains continue operating smoothly once Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra upgrade goes live on L1. By adding compatibility for new transaction types and block-header changes introduced with Pectra, this proposal mitigates the risk of chain stalls and large reorgs that could occur if OP Stack remains unadjusted. If approved, network operators will adopt updates to node clients and protocol components before Pectra’s mainnet activation, effectively treating the rollout as a soft fork that avoids any disruption to chain activity.


### **Cycle 33 Final Review Report**

Gonna.eth has posted the [Cycle 33 Final Review Report](https://gov.optimism.io/t/cycle-33-final-review-report/9721), marking the conclusion of the first Season 7 round under the Governance Fund Missions. Out of the participating projects, 7 applications secured approval (totaling 4.70M OP for TVL growth), 12 were deferred to the next cycle, and eight were declined. An additional three audit requests passed, allocating 150,930 OP in total. The remaining funds (around 4.65M OP) will roll over for Cycle 34.

One notable policy involved Orange Chain deployments, where projects must either deploy on at least one Green Chain or add co-incentives to their proposal. Looking ahead, 28 new TVL Growth applications and 21 audit requests have been submitted for Cycle 34. The GrantNerds plan refines the rubric and application forms, focusing on a smoother, more effective funding cycle.


### **Cycle 34 Preliminary Review Results**

Gonna.eth has [shared](https://gov.optimism.io/t/cycle-34-preliminary-review-results/9738) the Cycle 34 preliminary review results, indicating that 10 out of 27 newly submitted grants have passed the first phase, alongside 12 rollovers from the previous cycle. The GrantNerds scored each application, with a minimum score of 7 needed to advance. The cycle’s finalists collectively requested 13.73 million OP, while the Grants Council has 4.65 million OP budgeted for this round. Projects will now undergo a final review, supplemented by technical feedback from the Developer Advisory Board (DAB). Applicants who were declined or deferred can expect an NPS survey to gather feedback and refine future processes. Additionally, QuillAudits has been onboarded as a new whitelisted audit provider. The final grant decisions for Cycle 34 are slated for March 20th, following this review process.

[TMC Recommendation](https://v1.snapshot.box/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xc37793b67f39a6af9e9434003205b1d9b67dd6f75638329045257be823da4f18) - ends on March 14  at 00:00 UTC.


### **Proposal: For Arbitrum DAO to register the Sky Custom Gateway contracts in the Router**

Spike_stablelab has [created a post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-for-arbitrum-dao-to-register-the-sky-custom-gateway-contracts-in-the-router/28617) that proposes that the Arbitrum DAO update its Router configuration to register the Sky Custom Gateway contracts for bridging USDS and sUSDS tokens. While the tokens and their custom gateways are already live on Arbitrum, they’re currently disabled on the official Arbitrum Bridge UI, leaving users unable to transfer these stablecoins via Arbitrum’s standard bridging workflow. The request stems from the upcoming launch of Spark Liquidity Layer and Spark Savings, which will deploy significant stablecoin liquidity (including USDS and sUSDS) on Arbitrum. By adopting this proposal, the DAO would ensure that the official Arbitrum Bridge UI points to the correct token versions on Arbitrum, simplifying the user experience and fully supporting Sky’s stablecoin ecosystem.


### **SOS - Initiation Announcement Feb ‘25**

Entropy has made an update regarding the SOS proposal [announcing](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/sos-initiation-announcement-feb-25/28400/4?u=manugotsuka) the end of the notice period and the start of the Submission period. During the Submission Period, delegates and contributors are invited to publish their objectives matrix submissions. This new stage will last from February 24 to March 26. To apply, interested users must create a forum topic in the  [Strategic Objective Setting (SOS) subcategory](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/dao-grant-programs/strategic-objective-settings-sos/62) following the format shared [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/sos-initiation-announcement-feb-25/28400#p-66789-breakdown-of-each-period-expected-startend-dates-2).


### **Curia Forum Score Integration: Measuring Delegate Engagement Beyond Voting**

Curia has [created a post ](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/curia-forum-score-integration-measuring-delegate-engagement-beyond-voting/28570)to announce the introduction of a Forum Score Integration aimed at quantifying a delegate’s off-chain engagement in Arbitrum governance. By tracking participation—such as proposal creation, discussions, and time spent reading forum posts—this new score complements on-chain voting records, offering a more holistic view of each delegate's contributions. Forum Score calculates three main metrics (Proposal, Engagement, and Activeness), normalizes them, and aggregates them into a final rating. Delegates can verify their forum accounts on [arbitrum.curiahub.xyz](arbitrum.curiahub.xyz), enabling a more transparent display of their overall involvement. Curia encourages feedback on refining the scoring process—adjusting metrics, revising forum categories, or enhancing user experience—so that governance participants receive more apparent recognition for their off-chain efforts.


### **The Bible ‹› Delegate Incentive Program (DIP) - Manual for Delegates**

SEEDGov has [published](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/the-bible-delegate-incentive-program-dip-manual-for-delegates/28642?u=manugotsuka) the Delegate Incentive Program (DIP) Bible, a resource that outlines the updated rules, scoring, and compensation for ArbitrumDAO delegates. The document explains the criteria for measuring delegate governance contributions, provides performance tiers, clarifies payment structures, and covers dispute resolution. As the DIP evolves, all improvements and new rules will be reflected in the current DIP v1.6 document, with older versions accessible for reference. SEEDGov encourages the community to provide feedback on both the General Guide and the most recent update, ensuring that delegates remain informed and can optimize their participation in the DIP.

## **Uniswap**


### **[RFC] Saga and Uniswap v3 Liquidity Incentives**

Beccaliao from Saga has [introduced an RFC](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-saga-and-uniswap-v3-liquidity-incentives/25309) proposing $250k in UNI incentives over six months to bolster Uniswap v3 liquidity on Saga. The Saga team will also provide 2 million SAGA tokens monthly (~$1 million USD) for liquidity incentives. Through Saga’s partnership with GFX Labs, Uniswap v3 is already deployed on a Saga “chainlet”, and Oku will serve as the DEX’s front end, with all related integration and maintenance costs covered by the Saga Foundation.

The proposed UNI rewards would specifically target five pools—SAGA/USDC, ETH/USDC, SAGA/ETH, USDC/USDT, and SAGA/UNI—while Saga’s distribution of SAGA incentives may adjust over time. With the DAO approval, UNI incentives would begin after Oku’s go-live date, aligning with Saga’s monthly vault cycles. 


### **[RFC] LightLink Application for Canonical Uniswap V3 Deployment**

Dancube from LightLink [created a canonical proposal](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-lightlink-application-for-canonical-uniswap-v3-deployment/25332/1) for an existing Uniswap V3 deployment on LightLink, an optimistic L2 chain focused on enterprise use cases and user-friendly, zero-gas transactions. GFX Labs has already deployed the Uniswap V3 contracts, requiring no further DAO actions. If recognized, LightLink becomes an official V3 instance governed by Ethereum Layer 1 Uniswap governance. The final step is to update the v3-deployments.uniswap.eth ENS subdomain so that the accountability committee references the verified contracts.


### **[RFC] Deploy Uniswap V3 on GOAT Network**

GOAT_Network has created an [RFC that proposes](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-deploy-uniswap-v3-on-goat-network/25338) the integration of Uniswap v3 deployment on GOAT Network as canonical. The chain – an L2 focusing on BTC and DOGE yield – has already integrated Uniswap v3 contracts and a front end courtesy of Oku. Under this proposal, no additional DAO action is required; the Accountability Committee would simply update the v3-deployments.uniswap.eth ENS record to reflect GOAT Network’s canonical v3 instance.


### **[RFC] Deploy Uniswap V3 on Hemi**

0xpranjal from Hemi Labs has [introduced an RFC](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-deploy-uniswap-v3-on-hemi/25307) to recognize the existing Uniswap v3 deployment on Hemi, an L2 that merges Bitcoin and Ethereum for enhanced interoperability. The standard Uniswap v3 contracts have already been deployed by GFX Labs, requiring no additional DAO action. If this is accepted, a reference to Hemi’s deployment will simply be added to the official v3-deployments.uniswap.eth ENS record.


### **在 Uniswap V4 上开发适合短线交易员界面的提议**

Mayby1975 [proposes](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-v4/25344) building a Uniswap Pro interface on Uniswap v4 that caters explicitly to short-term traders and perpetual traders. According to the proposal, Uniswap currently focuses on spot swaps and long-term LPs, missing the substantial market of high-frequency and leveraged trading


### **Uniswap DAO Financial Report**

Jengajojo has shared a [Uniswap DAO Financial Report](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-dao-financial-report/25336) (covering 2020–2024) produced by DAOplomats.eth. The document provides insights into Uniswap’s historical revenues, treasury spending, and overall financial standing. By offering detailed figures and trends, the report aims to help the DAO make more informed decisions about future financial strategies.

## **Hop**


### **[RFC] Rebalance Lead Moderator Compensation Structure to 66% USDC and 33% $HOP**

Rxpwnz has introduced an [RFC proposing](https://forum.hop.exchange/t/rfc-rebalance-lead-moderator-compensation-structure-to-66-usdc-and-33-hop/1325) a change to the Lead Moderator compensation structure for the Hop Protocol community. Currently, the Lead Moderator receives $3,000 monthly, with 50% in USDC and 50% in HOP (linearly vested over one year). However, the HOP portion has yet to be distributed due to a lack of a vesting contract.

The new arrangement would rebalance future payments to 66% in USDC ($2,000) and 33% in HOP ($1,000), based on monthly TWAP and vested linearly over 12 months. This adjustment aims to provide increased financial stability (in light of rising living expenses) while preserving alignment through partial compensation in HOP tokens. If approved, the updated structure would start with the next monthly reward distribution (March 5, 2025), and it would not retroactively affect any pending HOP allocations.


### **Delegate Incentive Table (Q2 & Q3 2024)**

Francom [has presented](https://forum.hop.exchange/t/delegate-incentive-table-q2-q3-2024/1329) the Delegate Incentive Table for Q2 & Q3 2024, listing compensation amounts for delegates who exceeded the 30,000 HOP minimum delegation threshold and fulfilled the participation and communication requirements.

## **Starknet**


### **Staking on Starknet V2 - vote proposal**

BoazStark has [created a proposal](https://community.starknet.io/t/staking-on-starknet-v2-vote-proposal/115408) to upgrade Starknet Staking to Version 2, incorporating validator block attestation and a more flexible commission model to support validators. The proposal outlines an epoch-based system, where validators must attest to a selection of blocks in each epoch to prove reliability. Those failing to attest in time receive no rewards in that epoch. Additionally, validators could set and commit to a maximum commission rate (with a locked upper bound until a specified future epoch), providing clear expectations to delegators. The timeline is Q1 2025 for a testnet launch and Q2 2025 for mainnet adoption.


### **Changes to the delegated voting power by the foundation**

Henri.lieutaud has [outlined](https://chatgpt.com/c/679a8838-e47c-8008-b8d4-27388bb0ea01) the Starknet Foundation’s new 3-Tier Delegate System, redistributing 1.7B STRK among active community members. The foundation encourages broader participation and rewards delegates who consistently engage in governance. Under the new system:



* Tier 1 (700M STRK): ~20 delegates, 35M each
* Tier 2 (600M STRK): ~60 delegates, 10M each
* Tier 3 (400M STRK): ~100 delegates, 4M each

Builders Council members transition into Tier 1 delegates with individual allocations, while Tier 2 and 3 spots prioritize active participants. The foundation also introduces monthly governance assemblies on Discord – open to anyone, live-streamed on YouTube – where SNIP authors present proposals, delegates discuss, and the community aligns on technical/roadmap updates. Delegates must meet minimum engagement standards (attending assemblies, voting, contributing in technical threads); those who remain inactive risk losing their allocated STRK in subsequent reviews. Over time, these Tiers and delegate roles may evolve based on community needs and performance.


### **Cairo v2.11.0 is out!**

FeedTheFed [announces](https://community.starknet.io/t/cairo-v2-11-0-is-out/115438) Cairo 2.11.0, focusing on high-level compiler updates that enhance development comfort while remaining fully compatible with Starknet v0.13.4. This release adds richer iterator and option APIs, allows direct references to enum variants, introduces const functions for compile-time evaluations, enables storage “scrub” operations, and expands the Vec interface with push/pop. Early returns and error propagation now work inside loops, semicolons after curly-brace loops are no longer needed, and the compiler gains initial procedural macro support.


### **Aligned-stake (Starknet stake)**

Noeljarillo [introduces AlignedStake](https://community.starknet.io/t/aligned-stake-starknet-stake/115433), a beta-phase dApp designed to diversify Starknet’s validator set by offering real-time analytics, validator dashboards, fair delegation mechanisms, a split-staking option, and overall stake management. Current staking on Starknet is dominated by a few major entities, leading to an imbalance that endangers decentralization, security, and sustainability. AlignedStake aims to correct this by empowering smaller validators to attract delegations, promoting decentralized stake distribution, and providing transparent insights into performance and impact.

### **RFC - Everclear Security Task Force**

GNSPS is [resurfacing a previous](https://forum.connext.network/t/rfc-everclear-security-task-force/1259/10?u=manugotsuka) security review agreement with the DAO on behalf of Creed, requesting retroactive approval for an additional 2 person weeks of work performed under the Everclear Security Task Force initiative. The team allocated these extra hours to a detailed security assessment of the Arbitrum Rewards contracts, ensuring a more comprehensive safety review of key protocol components.

Following the EGP 21 rate structure, the total owed is $32,000, equating to 2 person weeks at $16,000 each. As per the original terms, payment should be made in CLEAR, using a 30-day VWAP to determine the token conversion amount. If accepted, the DAO will provide 952,237.90 CLEAR based on the example VWAP calculation. This proposal covers only the unpaid extension of Creed’s security review work, preserving the discount and payment model outlined in the earlier agreement.


### **RFC - Increasing Liquidity for CLEAR via Mainnet Vault**

Rapha-Raffaelo has [created a post](https://forum.connext.network/t/rfc-increasing-liquidity-for-clear-via-mainnet-vault/1368) proposing to bridge 3.84 M CLEAR from the Arbitrum DAO Safe to Ethereum mainnet and deposit it into an Arrakis mainnet vault. This would enhance buy-side liquidity for CLEAR while using natural trading volume to convert a portion of these tokens into wETH over time. By repurposing the DAO’s idle CLEAR, the proposal aims to reduce slippage for potential buyers, gradually strengthen the vault's base asset (wETH) ratio, and make more efficient use of the 3.84 M tokens currently held on Arbitrum.

### **[ZIP-8] Upgrade Chain Creation Params**

StanislavBreadless [proposes](https://forum.zknation.io/t/zip-8-upgrade-chain-creation-params/591) ZIP-8 to resolve a mismatch in ChainCreationParams introduced after ZIP-6, which caused newly created chains to fail. This discrepancy stemmed from inconsistent compilation states (with or without a node_modules folder), causing the genesisBatchHash and genesisBatchCommitment to differ from the era-contracts repository. By aligning these parameters with the official references and deploying an updated L1GenesisUpgrade contract to fix the default wrapped base token name, the proposal ensures seamless chain creation post-ZIP6 without needing additional actions from existing chains.


### **TPP Builder Presentation Signup**

Theshelb[ created a post](https://forum.zknation.io/t/tpp-builder-presentation-signup/585) to invite token mechanic builders and service providers to showcase their tools during upcoming ZKsync Delegate calls, offering three ten-minute demo slots per session. By demonstrating how their solutions fit into potential TPP (Token Program) designs, presenters can illustrate how token mechanic “building blocks” can be combined into cohesive, DAO-aligned frameworks. The calls, scheduled from March 18th to April 29th, will include participants from the ZKsync Foundation, Matter Labs, and other ecosystem contributors; token mechanic teams are encouraged to sign up by commenting on the forum post.


### **A Shared Roadmap for ZKsync**

Be1garat, from the ZKsync Foundation, applauds the progress made in governance and outlines a plan to circulate proposals aimed at expanding security, core development, shared infrastructure, and ZK Chain & ZKsync adoption. The Foundation advocates an approach that emphasizes mechanism design (e.g., token mechanics, futarchy, and conditional funding markets) over human discretion while also limiting overhead costs to between 0–3% per proposal. Additionally, the Foundation aims to minimize fragmentation by encouraging modular, open-source infrastructure and consolidating supervisory roles, ensuring a more efficient, transparent environment across multiple proposals. As the Foundation prepares to share initial drafts, service providers and community members are invited to participate in crafting a sustainable future for ZKsync.


### **ZKsync Ignite Update and Period 5 Allocations - March 2, 2025**

0xk3y [updates](https://forum.zknation.io/t/zksync-ignite-update-and-period-5-allocations-march-2-2025/579?u=manugotsuka) the community on ZKSync Ignite’s Period 4 results and reveals a new Period 5 allocation strategy emphasizing capital efficiency and stable slippage rather than maximizing TVL. Despite market volatility causing a roughly $19.95M TVL reduction among incentivized protocols, stable price execution was maintained for WETH-ZK. 

Accordingly, Period 5 significantly cuts incentives (down roughly 56% from Period 4) with fewer pools supported, reduced emphasis on Lending and Perps, and a focus on key pairs at near-Period-3 levels. While some pools (like iZUMi.finance’s USDC.e-WETH) have been defunded, newly incentivized pairs include RFX: USN. With a total budget of 5,446,958.45 ZK, the changes align with Ignite’s updated priorities: sustaining price execution, minimizing slippage, and dedicating less capital to less effective pools. Following a Safe sign-off delay caused by a recent technical incident, Period 5 incentives are now live.


### **ZIP-6 — Security Council Verification**

ZKSC from the Security Council has [shared its verification findings](https://forum.zknation.io/t/zip-6-security-council-verification/574) for ZIP-6, which prepares ZKsync for the upcoming ZK Gateway by adding a two-stage upgrade. The Security Council focused on ensuring the second upgrade would only occur after a 14-day wait following the first, as enforced by checkDeadline() in the GovernanceUpgradeTimer. To aid their review, the proposal’s author supplied a verification tool, which allowed members to confirm that the emergency upgrade path and delay mechanism were correctly implemented. With no reported issues, the Security Council concludes that the ZIP-6 call data is valid and aligns with ZKsync’s governance and security guidelines.


### **ZIP-5 — Security Council Verification**

ZKSC from the Security Council has concluded its review of ZIP-5, confirming that the associated call data is essentially correct but noting three key issues:



1. Voting Delay and Quorum Extension:
* The proposal initially stated a 2-day late quorum vote extension, whereas the call data reflects 3 days.
* The ZIP-5 forum post has been updated to match the call data, confirming that 3 days is the intended value for both the voting delay and quorum extension.
2. Refund Recipient Address:
* A default Foundry address was erroneously listed as the recipient for refund transactions.
* While not a security risk, it’s not the intended address for refunds. The proposal author chose not to revise it further due to minimal losses.
3. Emergency Upgrade:
* Multiple contracts (e.g., BridgeHub, StateTransitionManager, L1SharedBridge) require an acceptOwnership call, but ZIP-5 does not include that step.
* An Emergency Upgrade will finalize ZIP-5’s ownership transitions, which also provides an opportunity to test emergency functionality on mainnet.

With these clarifications, the Security Council supports the plan to initiate the Emergency Upgrade and advises the proposal author to keep the forum updated on its progress.

### **Proposal: Euclid Upgrade on Scroll**

Thegaram33 [created a post](https://forum.scroll.io/t/proposal-euclid-upgrade-on-scroll/543) that introduces Euclid, a two-phase upgrade for Scroll planned for April 2025, bringing significant changes to OpenVM-based proving, MPT state commitments, optimized rollup processes, EIP-7702 & RIP-7212 adoption for advanced smart accounts, and Stage-1 readiness. Phase-1 migrates the prover to OpenVM and replaces zktrie with MPT, while Phase-2 implements more efficient batch commitments, updated bridging, and new account standards. Users can expect lowered fees, improved throughput, and stronger censorship resistance, though brief interruptions will occur during each phase. Node operators must adopt new versions of `l2geth`, indexers should handle changes in blob-based batch encoding, and the entire process will be governed by Scroll DAO, with final execution by the Security Council.


### **Proposal: Scroll zkEVM Hackathon – Accelerating DeFi Innovation on Scroll**

DappsoverApps [proposes](https://forum.scroll.io/t/proposal-scroll-zkevm-hackathon-accelerating-defi-innovation-on-scroll/521) a Scroll zkEVM Hackathon that combines virtual labs, in-person developer bootcamps in Lagos, Nigeria, and a hybrid hackathon focused on DeFi solutions leveraging Scroll zkEVM. With $25,000 requested from the Scroll DAO and an additional $5,000 from the Ethereum Support Program, the initiative aims to onboard 50–100 new developers, produce 10–20 viable DeFi MVPs that will feed into Scroll’s DAO DeFi Grant Program, and foster a lasting developer community. By targeting DeFi innovation on Scroll’s zero-knowledge rollup technology, the proposal seeks to strengthen the network’s ecosystem through hands-on education, real-world development experience, and structured post-hackathon mentorship.
