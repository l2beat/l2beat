## **Optimism**

### **Cycle 34 Grants Council final report**

Gonna.eth [has shared the final outcomes](https://gov.optimism.io/t/cycle-34-grants-council-final-report/9774/1) of Cycle 34, the second round of grants under Season 7. Of the applications received, five were approved (totaling 1,364,000 OP for TVL Growth), eight were deferred to Cycle 35, and 9 were declined. Audit applications remain pending, and an updated rubric now assesses “Application Readiness” alongside interoperability requirements and co-incentives for orange chains.

The Grants Council also welcomed Immunefi and Certora to the whitelisted Auditing Service Providers and confirmed that [10 select projects](https://gov.optimism.io/t/cycle-34-grants-council-final-report/9774) will participate in the Futarchy experiment. Regarding Retrofunding, the Council is tying its 50,000 OP retro budget to a TVL KPI (10M OP in TVL), distributing the reward proportionally based on how much of that target is achieved. With Cycle 35 on the horizon, the Council looks forward to further refining the grants process and scaling ecosystem growth.

### **Service Provider Utilisation Framework**

Immutablelawyer [has introduced](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-service-provider-utilisation-framework/28771) a proposal to improve Arbitrum DAO’s ability to engage with external service providers by creating an “OpEx” budget rail—now called the “Service Provider Utilisation Framework.” Under the current model, even routine service providers must go under a full governance proposal lifecycle, causing operational inefficiencies and lengthy delays. The new framework suggests a two-tiered approach in which service providers (previously whitelisted) have streamlined access to DAO initiatives while maintaining robust oversight. Smaller contract agreements (under $80k) would require only OpCo sign-off and on-chain execution, whereas more significant engagements (over $80k) would use an optimistic governance model featuring a short challenge period.

According to the proposal, with this approach of separating provider whitelisting from individual project approvals, the DAO reduces repetitive proposal drafting and can rapidly deploy specialized services (e.g., security audits and research) without compromising transparency or accountability. 


### **TMC Proposed Allocations V2 – Stablecoin Strategy**

Threesigmaxyz [has created](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/tmc-proposed-allocations-v2-stablecoin-strategy/28786) a revised plan under which the Arbitrum Foundation would convert 15M ARB into stablecoins and place them under the management of three selected partners—Karpatkey, Avantgarde & Myso, and Gauntlet—each receiving an equal 33% share. The proposal recommends voting Yes to deploy this stablecoin strategy.

Under this framework, the stablecoins would be deployed in low-risk yield-bearing protocols such as Aave, Compound, Pendle, and Fluid, with target returns ranging from 5% to 12%. To maintain long-term sustainability, only the yield (not the principal) would be used to address service provider shortfalls, and the Arbitrum Foundation would have discretion in releasing those funds. The TMC has evaluated multiple proposals, ultimately shortlisting Karpatkey, Avantgarde & Myso, and Gauntlet based on risk management, transparency, track record, and alignment with DAO goals.


### **TMC Proposed Allocations V2 – ARB Strategy**

Threesigmaxyz [has posted](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/tmc-proposed-allocations-v2-arb-strategy/28785) an updated plan under which 10M ARB would be deployed into on-chain yield strategies, managed 50/50 by Karpatkey and Avantgarde & Myso. While both teams propose covered-call and lending-based approaches, the Treasury Management Committee (TMC) ultimately recommends voting No on this ARB allocation.

The TMC’s review found insufficient transparency around counterparty liquidity, strike selection, and real-world scalability of the covered-call components, coupled with relatively low returns (near 0.16% for lending) that do not justify the risk. As a result, the committee favors holding ARB until more robust, clearly defined strategies emerge.


### **GCP Clawback**

NathanVDH and GFXLabs [have proposed](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-gcp-clawback/28809) to claw back the funds that the GCP did not commit to or utilize. The idea is to gradually wind down the Arbitrum Gaming Catalyst Program (GCP) and recover the remaining unallocated funds. Their recommendation follows reduced activity, key membership changes, and community requests for more transparent reporting. To preserve the DAO’s resources, the proposal calls for halting non-essential GCP expenditures, returning unspent capital to the DAO treasury, and revoking unvested compensation. A transition period, including up to six months of severance for non-Council contributors, is included to ensure fairness. 


### **Stylus Sprint Program Updates**

Entropy [has created a post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stylus-sprint-program-updates/28790) with updates on the Stylus Sprint program. The report clarifies that most teams receiving the grants have completed the KYB/KYC process and begun working on their deliverables. Specifically, Sylow, CoBuilders (GUI for the Cache Manager), ArbOS Foundry, and Fiet Protocol (formerly Surety) have already submitted their first milestone reports to the committee for review, and they expect several more in the next few weeks. To keep the committee and all DAO members informed, Entropy has created an [X thread list](https://x.com/i/lists/1899430297638224379) of all the Stylus Sprint participants that can be followed to help amplify any posts.


### **Arbitrum D.A.O. Grant Program Season 3 - Official Thread**

Jojo has [created a post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-d-a-o-grant-program-season-3-official-thread/28753?u=manugotsuka) announcing the beginning of the Questbook Domain Allocator program V3. There will be five categories in which users can submit their applications to receive grants. The categories are:

## **Uniswap**


### **[RFC] Deploy Uniswap v2, v3 on Soneium**

Mingshi [has introduced a proposal](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-deploy-uniswap-v2-v3-on-soneium/25413) for the canonical deployment of Uniswap v2 and v3 on Soneium, an Ethereum L2 developed by Sony Block Solutions Labs. The protocol has already been deployed by Uniswap Labs, with ownership transferred to the DAO, and it awaits a 7-day optimistic approval. Soneium recently launched its mainnet, reaching over 60M on-chain transactions and 4M unique wallets in just eight weeks. Tied closely to Sony’s IPs and broader consumer distribution channels, the network aims to host DeFi, gaming, NFTs, and real-world assets. By expanding to this new chain, Uniswap would gain exposure to Sony’s user base, align with ecosystem incentive programs, and grow its presence within the Superchain framework.

## **Polygon**


### **PIP-61: Pectra EIPs**

H_Rook [has created a post](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-61-pectra-eips/20783) introducing the PIP-61, a subset of Pectra EIPs on the Polygon PoS network. By merging upstream changes from Ethereum’s mainnet (where “Pectra” is an upcoming hard fork), the proposal seeks to enable EIP-2537, EIP-2935, EIP-7623, and EIP-7702 on Polygon. Several other EIPs that are consensus-layer-specific (like EIP-6110 and EIP-7002) are excluded due to incompatibility with Polygon PoS. As these upgrades require changes to Bor’s implementation, PIP-61 constitutes a hard fork, maintaining alignment with Ethereum’s evolution while respecting Polygon’s existing architecture.


### **Heimdall v1.2.1 release**

0xsajal from the Polygon Validators Support Team [has announced](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/heimdall-v1-2-1-release/20800/1) the release of Heimdall v1.2.1, which includes an important security patch for Tendermint. Node operators on both mainnet and amoy are advised to upgrade promptly. Before installing, they suggest remembering to back up the current configuration file. Then, after stopping the heimdalld service, run the installation script with the appropriate version, network name, and node type, verify the update and restart the services.
