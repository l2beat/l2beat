## **Optimism**

### **Retro Funding 4: Onchain Builders - round details**

Optimism Foundation published the round details for the 4th round of Retro Funding. Retro Funding 4 will reward on-chain builders who have deployed contracts to the Superchain and contributed to the success of Optimism with a total of 10,000,000 OP. Applications will be open between May 23rd and June 6th and you can [read about the application process here](https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-application-process/8013)

Additionally, the Foundation [has published](https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-application-review-process/8012) the framework for the application review process of future Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) rounds and its application to Retro Funding 4. The application review process is applied to decide which applicants are eligible to participate in retro rounds and is used to enforce application rules and eligibility criteria.

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

We’re interested in hearing peoples’ thoughts on the design of the round as it will help us form our own opinions and will ultimately make it into feedback which we can share with the Collective to inform future rounds’ design.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss all of the above and more during our [Optimism Office Hours](meet.google.com/pem-jzrh-gkq) every Tuesday at 3 pm UTC.

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

There are currently multiple different initiatives being worked on in tandem that will soon go to Snapshot.

The total amount requested is $64,000 which will be evenly distributed among the 8 participants.

### **Findings from Uniswap Delegate Reward Working Group**

Doo from StableLabs [published a summary](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/findings-from-uniswap-delegate-reward-working-group/23702) of the findings of the delegate rewards working group which has been conducting research and working on assessing the current landscape of Uniswap governance and delegate responsibilities, all to build the framework for a successful Delegate Reward Initiative.

### **Starknet Provisions Update**

These subcategories are:

1. Pooled stakers

3. VeVe users

Eligible users from the aforementioned categories will now be able to claim their allocated STRK.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss the above and more during our [Starknet Office Hours](http://meet.google.com/avz-chuc-ksa) every Friday at 3 pm UTC.

## **Connext**

### **Vote - Extension of Airdrop Claim Period**

[This proposal](https://forum.connext.network/t/extension-of-airdrop-claim-period-for-connext-users/1081) requests extending the claim period of Connext’s airdrop for users who missed out due to a lack of awareness. The overall cost of the proposal is an amount of $NEXT up to the sum of all unclaimed airdrops, which is somewhere around 34 million $NEXT.

The [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/dao.connext.eth/proposal/0xbc79402f30cd65e65854102a70e7775843001c687b40d0d7b298db53b2652529) ends on April 27 2024 at 6:18 am UTC.

### **Vote - Partnership Token Agreements**

[This proposal](https://forum.connext.network/t/rfc-partnership-token-agreements/938) by Connext Foundation seeks approval from the DAO to award a total of 28,450,000 NEXT tokens to long-standing partners of Connext for their meaningful contributions. Specifically, the proposal seeks to allocate the following partners with the corresponding amounts as outlined below:

- Veil - 3,000,000 NEXT
- Wonderland - 25,000,000 NEXT
- Bootnode - 450,000 NEXT

The [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/dao.connext.eth/proposal/0xd7fdf3d86633c16621f1d63effd2f5796a886f89621d1c610aff509db6ffc223) ends on May 2 2024 at 1:17 pm UTC.

### **[RFC] Adopt Partial Private Voting**

Jengajojo [submitted an RFC](https://forum.connext.network/t/rfc-adopt-partial-private-voting/1170) that advocates for the implementation of shielded voting within Connext DAO’s governance process, utilizing the Shutter implementation on the Snapshot. This will prevent the voting process from altering voting outcomes. Enabling shielded voting doesn’t come at a cost to the DAO other than the operational overhead for its implementation.

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

We’d like to discuss if there are any opportunities that could potentially enable the users who didn’t claim the airdrop within the 6-month claim window to participate and earn some $NEXT in the process.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss all the above and more during our [Connext Office Hours](meet.google.com/twm-jafw-esn) every Friday at 3 pm UTC.
