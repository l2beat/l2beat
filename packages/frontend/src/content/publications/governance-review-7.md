## **Optimism**

### **Experimentation: Impact Metric based voting**

Jonas from the Optimism Foundation [published a post](https://gov.optimism.io/t/experimentation-impact-metric-based-voting/7727/1) that describes the ongoing experiment of impact metric-based voting. In the post, you can find information about a prototype of a metric-based voting interface called ‘impact calculator’. The idea is that badgeholders will be able to choose what types of impact they think are important and assign different weights to them instead of going through each project and evaluating it individually.

There’s also a call for feedback at the end of the post with some specific questions so make sure you go and drop your thoughts in the replies below.

### **Building a private, on-chain, implementation for RetroPGF**

Samajammin [published a post](https://gov.optimism.io/t/building-a-private-on-chain-implementation-for-retropgf/7733) that shares what their team has been working on – private, bribery-resistant, on-chain voting for Optimism’s RPGFrounds.

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

While RPGF has been an overall successful endeavor, there are still ways in which we can improve future rounds. Following the third round, there have already been a lot of discussions, research, and ideation about different approaches to executing RPGF rounds. We’re interested in participating in the discussion and helping by providing our thoughts and feedback.

**When/where to catch us**

You can find us to discuss all the above and more during our [Optimism Office Hours](meet.google.com/pem-jzrh-gkq) every Tuesday at 4 pm UTC.

## **Arbitrum**

### **Temp Check - Proposal to fund Plurality Labs Milestone 1B(ridge)**

Following [their RFC](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-proposal-to-fund-plurality-labs-milestone-1b-ridge/21332), Plurality Labs has moved their proposal to temp check. As a reminder, the new proposal requests the same amount of funding and the same timeframe as their original one, which is 3,360,000 ARB for 6 months. Of that 3,36M ARB, 336k will be the compensation for Plurality Labs, 224k will be the compensation for program management, and the remaining 2.776M ARB will be distributed through grants.

The [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x24344ab10eb905a4d7fa5885c6f681290e765a08a5f558ff6cfc5fedab42afb6) ends on March 7th at 9:24 pm UTC.

As L2BEAT, we’ll be abstaining from this vote as we’re part of the Advisory Board which is tasked with overseeing the execution by Plurality Labs.

### **[RFC] Delegate to a public access, public good retail enfranchisement pool through Event Horizon**

EventHorizonDAO [submitted an RFC](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegate-to-a-public-access-public-good-retail-enfranchisement-pool-through-event-horizon/21523) that seeks to request a delegation (not grant) of 5,000,000 ARB to a public access-voter block subject to meeting emission timelines as well as participation/output-based KPIs outlined below and a clawback after 1 year if the DAO votes to do so. Arbitrum community members may mint a free, soul-bound Voter Pass which allows them to take part in mobilizing this voter pool.

### **GovHack Proposals**

During [GovHack](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/govhack-ethdenver-powered-by-hack-humanity/21119/6), there were a lot of proposals that were drafted and a lot of discussions that took place. You can review all of the [proposals created during GovHack here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/arbitrum-govhack/26).

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

Even though GovHack is now finished, the proposals created during the event don’t have to be. There were a lot of interesting topics being discussed and being worked on and we believe it’s worthwhile to bring some of the proposals to the DAO, improve them, and have them go through the governance process. Also, we find the concept of meta-governance interesting and we’re keen to discuss it with others in the community to form a stronger opinion on it.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss all the above and more during our [Arbitrum Office Hours](meet.google.com/jkj-nnop-arc) every Thursday at 4 pm UTC.

## **Uniswap**

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

With everyone away at ETHDenver, more things are happening IRL than in the forums. GovHack is expected to create some activity in the DAO and we’re looking forward to seeing what comes out of it.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss all things Uniswap during our [Uniswap Office Hours](http://meet.google.com/twm-jafw-esn) every Friday at 4 pm UTC.

## **Hop**

### **[RFC] Renewal of the Hop Delegate Incentivization Trial (3rd Period)**

Following up on an RFC submitted in January, [Francom proposed](https://forum.hop.exchange/t/rfc-renewal-of-the-hop-delegate-incentivization-trial-3rd-period/1097/10) renewing the delegate incentivization program for another 6 months and increasing delegate pay by 2.5x while also adding a gas reimbursement fund (capped at $500/month) as an experiment to see if we can attract and retain talent for the DAO.

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

Although we understand the notion that delegate incentives can potentially attract people to participate in governance, we’re skeptical of their ability to attract \_new \_people to participate in the DAO, simply because the requirements to receive delegate incentives already exclude new participants by default.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss all the above and more during our [Hop Office Hours](http://meet.google.com/twm-jafw-esn) every Friday at 4 pm UTC.

## **Polygon**

### **[PRC-34] Polygon Staking Layer**

Gretzke from PolygonLabs [published a PIP](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/prc-34-polygon-staking-layer/13587) that introduces the first PRC, which defines the smart contract interfaces and interactions between all components of the Polygon Staking Layer. The Polygon Staking Layer, as introduced in [PIP-18](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-18-polygon-2-0-phase-0-frontier/12913), is a standardized set of smart contracts that facilitate decentralized restaking within the Polygon ecosystem. The Staking Layer allows stakers to take on slashing risks in exchange for the ability to validate services.

You can [find the PRC here](https://github.com/maticnetwork/Polygon-Improvement-Proposals/blob/main/PIPs/PRC/PRC-34.md).

### **Account Abstraction Proposals Comparison**

Gretzke from PolygonLabs [published](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/account-abstraction-proposals-comparison/13595) a comparison between different account abstraction proposals, following [PIP–22](https://github.com/maticnetwork/Polygon-Improvement-Proposals/blob/main/PIPs/PIP-22.md) that proposed to add account abstraction capabilities to the Polygon PoS network. The comparison discusses the most prominent AA proposals and evaluates their advantages and disadvantages.

### **zkEVM: The Elderberry upgrade is on testnet**

J_Nicolas from PolygonLabs - zkEVM [announced](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/zkevm-the-elderberry-upgrade-is-on-testnet/13588) that the Elderberry upgrade is now on Cardona (Sepolia) Testnet and that it will go live on Mainnet around March 7, given that the network is stable.

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

We’re interested in discussing both the Polygon Restaking Layer and the Account Abstraction poroposals.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss all the above and more during our [Polygon Office Hours](meet.google.com/avz-chuc-ksa) every Friday at 3 pm UTC.

## **Starknet**

### **Starknet v0.13.1 pre-release notes**

Ilia from StarkWare [published the pre-release notes](https://community.starknet.io/t/starknet-v0-13-1-pre-release-notes/113664) for Starknet v0.13.1 which deals mostly with stability and performance improvements. There are action items for full nodes, API providers, SDKs, wallets, and dApps.

The tentative release dates are March 4 for Testnet and March 11 for Mainnet.

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

We’re looking to connect with active participants in Starknet. Whether you’re a builder or a delegate, we want to hear from you.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss all things Starknet during our [Starknet Office Hours](http://meet.google.com/avz-chuc-ksa) every Friday at 3 pm UTC.

## **Connext**

### **On Chain Vote - The Rollup Ecosystem Education Partnership Proposal**

Following delegate feedback during the second community call, The Rollup has revised [its original proposal](https://forum.connext.network/t/rfc-the-rollup-ecosystem-education-partnership-proposal/1043) and submitted it for an on-chain vote. The Rollup is proposing to become an educational content partner to Connext to drive product awareness, further engagement, and support product vision. The proposal seeks 100,000 $NEXT for a 6-month duration for the scope and deliverables described in the specification section of the proposal.

The [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/dao.connext.eth/proposal/0xdd4f77cdff542965435bf176acaa4b3fef24be43741837890d1ff7afa216f12f) ends on March 6, 2024 at 4:16 pm UTC.

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

While we think it can be useful to have a framework when working with any sort of service providers or DAO partners, we also believe that assessing individual proposals until the need for a more holistic approach arises makes sense. We’re curious to discuss this topic with other delegates and see how we can best balance both approaches, especially on the occasion of the two active proposals ([1](https://forum.connext.network/t/executable-cgp-8-proposal-for-having-an-incentivized-next-weth-gauge-at-bunni-on-ethereum-mainnet/1067), [2](https://forum.connext.network/t/propopsal-to-seed-next-liquidity-in-stella-lending-pools/1070/4)) currently in the forums around $NEXT incentives.
