### **Arbitrum D.A.O. (Domain Allocator Offerings) Grant Program –  Domain Allocator Applications**

After successfully passing temp-check, the Arbitrum D.A.O grant program [opens up the application process](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/election-application-thread-arbitrum-d-a-o-domain-allocator-offerings-grant-program/27909) for prospective domain allocators for the following domains:



* New Protocols and Ideas

* Dev Tooling on One and Stylus

The application is also open for a program manager. Interested parties should apply under the application thread using the provided template by January 5th. The elections are scheduled to begin on January 9th.


### **Are We Overlooking Marketing in Favor of Development in Arbitrum?**

LunarStrategy [published a post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/are-we-overlooking-marketing-in-favor-of-development-in-arbitrum/27904) seeking to start a discussion on whether or not Arbitrum DAO prioritizes development over marketing. In the post, they argue that while the DAO is giving plenty of development grants, marketing-related grants go overlooked and projects are not provided with the necessary marketing to help reach a broader audience.


### **Questbook DDA Program Report**

Entropy [published a program report](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/questbook-dda-program-report/27859) for Questbook’s DDA program, on occasion on the proposal to renew it for another year with a replenished budget and new domain allocators. The review focused on 5 top grantees from each of the four domains (total of 19 grantees reviewed). We encourage you to read through the report to better understand the program’s results so far and inform yourself before the new proposal goes to an onchain vote.


### **Entropy Advisors Transparency Report: Q1**

Entropy [published a transparency report](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/entropy-advisors-transparency-report-q1/27799) for the first quarter of their 1-year exclusive partnership with Arbitrum DAO. You can read the [full report here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WeHR2_inNgnXY4E3awX5eNsWeMO2KsXm/view).

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

With the end of the year dawning closer, we’re interested in doing aa sort of retrospective about all the different proposals and initiatives we’ve seen throughout 2024 in Arbitrum DAO. We’re curious to hear your thoughts about what worked well, and what could be improved going forward.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss all of the above and more during our [Arbitrum Office Hours](meet.google.com/jkj-nnop-arc) every Thursday at 4 pm UTC.

## **Uniswap**

Two new chains apply for a canonical deployment, Celo requests incentives, and the UAC proposes to use surplus budget for co-incentive campaigns. 


### **Uniswap Deployment - Guideline**

Alicecorsini, on behalf of the UAC, [published a guideline](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-deployment-guideline/25015) for chains who would like to obtain an official canonical Uniswap v3/v2 deployment on their chain and/or UNI incentives related to it. The guideline explains the process through which a chain can request a deployment, provides information on financial support and UNI incentives available, and also includes a template for a DAO proposal.


### **[RFC] Scale Uniswap Liquidity on Celo**

Michaelcelo [submitted an RFC](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-scale-uniswap-liquidity-on-celo/24995) on behalf of Stabila Foundation to request $250k in UNI incentives for six months to support seven key stablecoin-related pools on Celo, alongside $105k for Oku deployment and maintenance.If provided, Stabila Foundation will match the incentives with $500k in CELO incentives to amplify the impact of this initiative.


### **[RFC] Saga L1 Application for Canonical Uniswap V3 Deployment**

Beccaliao [submitted an RFC](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-saga-l1-application-for-canonical-uniswap-v3-deployment/25008) on behalf of Saga L1 that seeks to apply for a canonical v3 deployment. The DAO doesn’t need to take any further action as the RFC doesn’t request UNI incentives and the application for the deployment will be optimistically approved within a week.


### **[RFC] Discretionary Budget from UAC for Co-Incentive Campaigns**

Alphagrowth [submitted an RFC](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-discretionary-budget-from-uac-for-co-incentive-campaigns/25019) that proposes accelerating the execution of co-incentive campaigns by leveraging some of the UAC’s surplus budget to capitalize on high-impact, time-sensitive opportunities without needing any additional funding from the DAO. 

Due to the surge in UNI’s price, the UAC currently sits on ~$2,9M of surplus. The proposal requests the authority to use some of these surplus funds to enable high-value co-incentivization campaigns spearheaded by the Uniswap Growth Program. These surplus funds would be issued by an internal UAC vote on a case-by-case basis, ensuring the campaigns align with the goals of the Uniswap DAO and enabling the Uniswap Growth Program to act quickly on high-value opportunities. 


### **[RFC] Deploy Uniswap V3 on Corn, the Butter Network!**

Justin_corn [submitted an RFC](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-deploy-uniswap-v3-on-sonic-formerly-fantom/25024) on behalf of Corn Network that seeks to apply for a canonical v3 deployment. The DAO doesn’t need to take any further action as the RFC doesn’t request UNI incentives and the application for the deployment will be optimistically approved within a week.

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

We’re interested in discussing the proposal by the UAC to use the surplus budget for co-incentive campaigns as well as the implications that would have. We’re also happy to talk about any other initiatives that you think we should be aware of.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss all the above and more during our [Uniswap Office Hours](http://meet.google.com/twm-jafw-esn) every Friday at 4 pm UTC.


## **Hop**

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

Hop’s governance hasn’t seen any new developments over the last week. If you believe we might have missed something, please let us know.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss all the above and more during our [Hop Office Hours](http://meet.google.com/twm-jafw-esn) every Friday at 4 pm UTC.


## **Polygon**

The latest proposal that discusses deploying the stables on the PoS bridge into liquidity pools is all the rage in Polygon this week.


### **Pre-PIP: Polygon PoS Bridge Liquidity Program**

AllezLabs [published a proposal](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pre-pip-polygon-pos-bridge-liquidity-program/20284) to initiate discussion on gradually deploying the DAI, USDC & USDT reserves of the Polygon PoS Portal Bridge into curated liquidity pools to kickstart a new Ecosystem Incentives program to grow the DeFi ecosystems of Polygon PoS and the Agglayer.

The PoS bridge currently holds ~$1.3B of stablecoins, which makes it one of the largest, holders of stablecoins onchain. At the current benchmark lending rate for the 3 major stables this is an opportunity cost of around ~$70M annually. However, it’s important to note that the stables in the bridge belong to users and not to the DAO.

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

We’re very interested in discussing AllezLabs’ proposal as we believe it’s a very sensitive topic that we should be very careful about how we approach it. It has the potential to set a -perhaps unwanted- precedent.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss all the above and more during our [Polygon Office Hours](meet.google.com/avz-chuc-ksa) every Friday at 3 pm UTC.
