## **Optimism**

### **The Collective DAO Archives**

Justine of Optimism Foundation [published a tweet](https://twitter.com/lalalavendr/status/1763703589564735560?s=20) with links to the Collective DAO archives, which is all their open-source research about the development of DAOs in the Ethereum ecosystem.

The archives contain DAO design principles that will be an important piece of context for anybody who will be involved in governance design as part of the the collective’s [path to open metagovernance](https://gov.optimism.io/t/the-path-to-open-metagovernance/7728).

You can learn more information by listening to Justine explain on the [recording of the last joint-house community call here](https://gov.optimism.io/t/optimism-community-token-house-call-recaps-recordings-thread/6937/32).

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

We’re interested in discussing the Collective DAO archives and their contents as well as the path to open metagovernance with other delegates and interested parties.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss the above and more during our [Optimism Office Hours](meet.google.com/pem-jzrh-gkq) every Tuesday at 4 pm UTC.

## **Arbitrum**

### **On Chain Vote - Proposal to fund Plurality Labs Milestone 1B(ridge)**

[This proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-proposal-to-fund-plurality-labs-milestone-1b-ridge/21332) by Plurality Labs requests the same amount of funding and the same timeframe as their original one, which is 3,360,000 ARB for 6 months. Of that 3,36M ARB, 336k will be the compensation for Plurality Labs, 224k will be the compensation for program management, and the remaining 2.776M ARB will be distributed through grants.

The [Tally vote](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/21881347407562908848280051025758535553780110598432331587570488445729767071232?chart=bubble) will end on March 26 2024 at 9:31 pm UTC.

As L2BEAT, we’ll be abstaining from this vote as we’re part of the Advisory Board which is tasked with overseeing the execution by Plurality Labs.

### **Temp Check - Request for Continuation of the Arbitrum DDA Program Request**

As they’re nearing the end of allocating the initial grants budget, Questbook [submitted a proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/questbook-dda-program-phase-2-request-for-continuation/21326) to request continuation for their Delegated Domain Allocators program. Specifically, they proposed to start a new program for the Arbitrum Grants via DDA through Questbook with a budget of $4,000,000 spread across 4 domains over the next two quarters.

The [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x5bede8277e7fe0beef5764d2915d1d1c288fcc47747c6fa576b501f5cb3d6115) ends on March 18 2024 at 12:01 am UTC.

### **Temp Check - Front-end interface to force transaction inclusion during sequencer downtime**

WakeUp Labs [submitted a proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-front-end-interface-to-force-transaction-inclusion-during-sequencer-downtime/21247) that outlines the development of a simple but effective front-end interface that enables users to force-include transactions directly on L1 when the Arbitrum Sequencer is down, aiming to increase trust among end-users navigating the Arbitrum ecosystem.

The [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x57acaed2db622fa66de2bd70d3710f48984a5e55449a0bf6e4e661306d20d148) ends on March 20 2024 at 5:38 am UTC.

### **Temp Check - Catalyze Gaming Ecosystem Growth on Arbitrum**

Djinn [submitted a proposal for the creation of a Gaming Catalyst Program](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/catalyze-gaming-ecosystem-growth-on-arbitrum/22368) on behalf of the gaming working group. The Gaming Catalyst Program (GCP) is a model to rapidly accelerate Arbitrum’s support for game builders and also strategically allocate resources towards vetted experts to accelerate the onboarding and go-to-market of the best builders in the gaming industry. The proposal asks the DAO to earmark 200m ARB to develop the gaming ecosystem on Arbitrum and establish the network as the top choice for game builders across the landscape.

The funding will be allocated towards the following initiatives throughout a two year period:

1. Builder Onboarding & Growth - 160m ARB
2. Infrastructure Bounties - 40m ARB

_A more detailed breakdown of the total cost can be found in the full post._

This is one of the biggest proposals in Arbitrum DAO’s history both in terms of the amount requested but also in terms of the effect it could have if it’s successful.

The [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x1a9f2097b0b5a0021628e9edb0e7c9bffae4fdbb104f9996463e40a3129c7718) ends on March 22 2024 at 3:52 pm UTC

### **[RFC] Expand Tally Support for the Arbitrum DAO**

Frisson from Tally [submitted an RFC](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/expand-tally-support-for-the-arbitrum-dao/22387) that proposes to expand Tally’s support for the Arbitrum DAO by improving the proposal process, upgrading the Governor contracts, and highlighting delegate contributions. They also propose to ensure that the DAO is set up for success by researching specifications for partial delegation and shielded voting.

The expected timeline to execute the above is 4.5 months, and the overall cost is $220,000 paid in ARB.

### **[RFC] Empowering Underrepresented Delegates**

MattOnChain submitted an RFC that seeks to increase participation in the DAO by empowering underrepresented delegates who, despite active participation in governance, do not have sufficient voting power to have their ideas seriously considered. The proposal suggests creating a DAO-controlled Franchiser contract and distributing 1M in ARB each of up to 10 delegates who 1) currently have between 50,000 and 1,000,000 in voting power, 2) have shown an on-chain voting participation rate >80% in the last 3 months and 3) have been chosen as the top 10 delegates of these candidates by the DAO voted on in a Snapshot poll.

The proposed duration of the program is 1 year, with 10M ARB Being delegated to 10 delegates and $15,000 in ARB going to program management, which would include setting everything up and producing a quarterly report on how the program is going for the full duration.

### **[RFC] Double-down on STIP Successes**

Savvy DAO [submitted an RFC](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/double-down-on-stip-successes-stip-bridge/22353) that seeks to double down on the successes of the short-term incentives program (STIP). The proposal seeks 37.5M ARB to be distributed to eligible protocols – which is any protocol funded under STIP.

### **[RFC] Accounting for votes (ARB) that is locked in various projects**

Cp0x [submitted an RFC](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/accounting-for-votes-arb-that-locked-in-various-projects/22454) that seeks to start a discussion around the more than 13,500,000 ARB tokens that are locked in various protocols and therefore not used in governance. The discussion underneath the proposal suggests that there are ways to achieve that from a technical standpoint.

Although not fully ironed out yet, the proposal estimates a cost of 46,000 ARB and a timeline of 3 months to enable the use of the locked tokens in governance.

### **[RFC] One-Time ARB Donation to Givewell’s Top Charities Fund**

GrangerIncident[ submitted an RFC](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-one-time-arb-donation-to-givewell-s-top-charities-fund/22328) that proposes a one-time charitable donation of ARB from the Arbitrum DAO’s Treasury to Givewell’s [Top Charities fund](https://www.givewell.org/top-charities-fund). The proposed amount to be donated is 5,000,000 ARB.

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

Together with Ant Federation, we were recently elected as the DAO Advocate in the context of Arbitrum’s Research and Development Collective (ARDC). Apart from being interested in discussing the aforementioned proposals and RFCs as L2BEAT, we’re also interested in discussing them in our capacity as DAO Advocate and talking about where can direct the ARDC’s efforts.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss all of the above and more during our [Arbitrum Office Hours](meet.google.com/jkj-nnop-arc) every Thursday at 4 pm UTC.

## **Uniswap**

### **[RFC] Extension of the Uniswap-Arbitrum Grant Program (UAGP)**

Bernard from Areta [submitted an RFC](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/extension-of-the-uniswap-arbitrum-grant-program-uagp/23369) to propose the extension of the UAGP. Since its inception, the UAGP was the benefactor of a significant price increase of their allocated ARB tokens, which nearly doubled their capacity to fund projects.

Given the positive price action and the fact that UAGP denominates costs in USD to align with their grantees’ budgeting, they propose extending the program for another 3 months to utilize the extended runway. In that context, and following the discussions from GovSwap at ETHDenver, the UAGP team also proposes the conversion of ARB into USDC to ensure the extended runway.

Bernard also published an update on Uniswap-Arbitrum Grant Program which you can find [here](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-arbitrum-grant-program-uagp-program-update-thread/23367).

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

We’re interested in hearing the community’s thoughts on UAGP and its outcomes so far and discuss

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss the above and more during our [Uniswap Office Hours](http://meet.google.com/twm-jafw-esn) every Friday at 4 pm UTC.

## **Hop**

### **Temp Check - [HIP-46] Renewal of Delegate Incentives**

Francom has [submitted a proposal](https://forum.hop.exchange/t/rfc-renewal-of-the-hop-delegate-incentivization-trial-3rd-period/1097/1) that seeks to extend the Hop Delegate Incentivization Program for another 6-month period while integrating the feedback from community members to this new cycle.

The main proposed changes are for delegate compensation to have a 2.5x multiplier at the end of the formula to increase overall incentives for delegates, to add a gas rebate fund for delegate on-chain voting (capped at $500/month to be paid in HOP), and finally for delegate rewards to vest for a 6-month period.

The [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/hop.eth/proposal/0x89002ddb781af1a6221cce6bd3ec798465c33008d644d5024cfd053c27ee0ee0) ends on March 16 2024 at 9:17 pm UTC.

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

We believe delegate incentives should be renewed, but they also should be refreshed in the sense that tracking and reporting should become simpler for delegates. There seems to be a consensus on this in the discussion under the proposal. We’re happy to discuss with other delegates how we can balance having a system that works and not overloading delegates.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss the above and more during our [Hop Office Hours](http://meet.google.com/twm-jafw-esn) every Friday at 4 pm UTC.

## **Polygon**

We were not aware of any significant news that is relevant to the scope of our governance review for this week. We are however always interested in hearing about things we might have missed.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss all things Polygon during our [Polygon Office Hours](meet.google.com/avz-chuc-ksa) every Friday at 3 pm UTC.

## **Starknet**

### **Gaming Committee Launch - Advancing Starknet's Gaming Ecosystem**

The Starknet Foundation [announced](https://www.starknet.io/en/content/gaming-committee-launch-advancing-starknets-gaming-ecosystem) the formation of its Gaming Committee. Comprised of six experts, the Committee's mandate is to promote the growth of gaming on Starknet. The Committee is tasked with designing and recommending programs to incentivize developers to build games on Starknet and to incentivize players to use them. A total of 50 million STRK have been earmarked to fund proposals recommended by the gaming committee.

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

We’ll be following the Gaming Committee and their work as we’re interested in seeing how the gaming ecosystem is developed on Starknet. We’d love to discuss it with other delegates and see how we can support the Committee’s work.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss the above and more during our [Starknet Office Hours](http://meet.google.com/avz-chuc-ksa) every Friday at 3 pm UTC.

## **Connext**

### **Vote - Execution Bond Change**

Connext Foundation [is proposing](https://forum.connext.network/t/rfc-execution-bond-change/1077) changing the 5 WETH bond needed to request proposal execution to 2 WETH, so the oSnap bot can request execution and execute transactions automatically.

The [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/dao.connext.eth/proposal/0x515fd96554b3da2b7a54d6d355170139d6868bd4051758cf50a814136c0f8173) ends on March 20 2024 at 4:05 pm UTC

### **Vote - Connext Expansion Proposal V2**

[This proposal](https://forum.connext.network/t/rfc-connext-expansion-proposal-v2/1061) seeks approval from the Connext DAO to allow the Connext Foundation to add future protocol support for additional chains at its discretion in advance of the next network upgrade, which aims to make the process more automated.

If the proposal passes, the Security Council will execute the on-chain configuration transactions that are necessary for the inclusion of additional chains.

The [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/dao.connext.eth/proposal/0xce336993d145956fde4337def3831878f0002e173847b07561510017f679265d) ends on March 21 2024 at 7:00 pm UTC.

### **[Discussion] Connext Next Steps**

Ministro Del Dolar, in coordination with us, [published a post](https://forum.connext.network/t/connextdao-next-steps/1086) that aims to start a discussion around Connext’s next steps, and specifically around the next steps on $NEXT’s liquidity-related topics. With the end of the Liquidity Task Force sometime at the end of March, and with the several proposals that have recently been submitted around $NEXT liquidity, the DAO should start working on what we’ll do next.

### **[RFC] Extension of Airdrop Claim Period**

[This proposal](https://forum.connext.network/t/extension-of-airdrop-claim-period-for-connext-users/1081) advocates for extending the claim period of Connext’s airdrop for users who missed out due to lack of awareness, specifically targeting those who did not engage with Twitter trends regarding the airdrop announcement. The extension aims to offer fair opportunities for users to claim their airdrop rewards, fostering inclusivity within the Connext community.

The overall ‘cost’ of this proposal would be the sum of all unclaimed airdrops, which is somewhere around 34 million NEXT according to TommyR8 (Connext Foundation).

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

We’re interested in discussing what the next steps with the Liquidity Task Force should be and how we can create a framework to assess all liquidity-related proposals instead of going on a case-by-case basis.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss all the above and more during our [Connext Office Hours](meet.google.com/twm-jafw-esn) every Friday at 4 pm UTC.
