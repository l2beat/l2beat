## **Arbitrum**

On Arbitrum, the Security Council elections are coming; the Foundation requested additional funding to be used for key partnerships, and there are four active temp-checks.


## Active Votes 

**Temp-Check**

[[Aave DAO] LTIPP Grant Extension Request](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x785e8ed145d34ab4c9fea725cf0ce31267f90bc2ed4423e6e718c5e736e84c06) – ends on September 19 at 11:00 UTC

### **Security Council Registrations Open**

Arbitrum Foundation [announced on Twitter](https://twitter.com/arbitrum/status/1835317702027616357) that registrations for the upcoming Security Council elections have started and will continue for six days. Then the nominee selection process will commence on September 22nd, and finally, the elections will start on October 13th. The whole process will happen on [Tally](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/council/security-council/election/2).


### **[Non-Constitutional] Funds to Bolster Foundation’s Strategic Partnerships Budget**

The Arbitrum Foundation [submitted an RFC](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-funds-to-bolster-foundation-s-strategic-partnerships-budget/26775) that requests 250 million ARB with the primary objective of enabling further fostering of key strategic partnerships. The reason behind this request is how strategic partnership agreements are structured. \
 \
Agreements typically last a few years to align a project’s interests with the long-term objectives of the Arbitrum ecosystem. This results in capital being locked in commitments over the next few years, restricting the Foundation’s ability to pursue new partnerships and stay ahead of the competition now. 

The requested funds will only be used for new strategic partnerships and not for Arbitrum Foundation operating expenses, including marketing, operations, service providers, or existing signed agreements.


### **[RFC] Establishing a DAO Events Budget for 2025**

Entropy [submitted an RFC](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/establishing-a-dao-events-budget-for-2025/26734) that suggests earmarking a budget for events for 2025 and for Entropy to take the lead on running ongoing RFPs to satisfy the DAO’s event demands. The proposed event categories for this initiative are a) delegate gatherings and b) ecosystem growth events. It’s important to note that the earmarked funds are to be used to cover the costs of events proposed to and approved by the DAO. The proposed budget is $1,500,000 or about 4,000,000 ARB (incl. buffer) and is meant to cover 2 delegate gatherings and 4 events within 2025.


### **[RFC] Research on context and retention**

In collaboration with TogetherCrew, Daniel Ospina [submitted an RFC](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/research-on-context-and-retention/26807) requesting read access to Arbitrum’s Discourse and Discord API to run an analysis and present it to the community for research purposes. The proposal is only asking for permission to have read access to the API’s, and not for any money for the analysis.


### **[ARDC] Transaction Ordering Policies & Value Accrual in L2s: Timeboost, OP PGA, Fastlane & OEV Network**

Delphi Digital, in its capacity as a member of the ARDC, [published a memo](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/transaction-ordering-policies-value-accrual-in-l2s-timeboost-op-pga-fastlane-oev-network-ardc-research-deliverables/26771) on Arbitrum’s newly proposed transaction ordering policy – Timeboost. The memo explains how Timeboost works, compares it with other mechanisms like Optimism’s Priority Gas Auction (PGA), FastLane, and OEV Network proposed by API3. It also examines how these transaction ordering policies influence value capture at both the application and base layers.


### **Arbitrum DAO - Monthly Token Flow Report - August 2024**

Reg3n Finance [published](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-dao-monthly-token-flow-report-august-2024/26777) its monthly ‘Token Flow’ report for August 2024, covering all the DAO's financials.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss all of the above and more during our [Arbitrum Office Hours](https://meet.google.com/jkj-nnop-arc) every Thursday at 3 pm UTC.

## **Uniswap**

Although there are no active votes in Uniswap, several different discussions are currently taking place, with the most prominent being AlphaGrowth’s proposal to grow Uniswap through incentives and grants from other ecosystems.


### **[RFC] Uniswap Ecosystem Incentives Initiative**

Pgov, a member of the meta governance team (UADP), [published a post](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-ecosystem-incentives-initiative/24548) discussing their interest in working with AlphaGrowth to increase Uniswap’s presence and engagement with the target chains on which it is currently deployed. Such a move could enable the DAO to leverage incentives from other ecosystems, just as it did with Arbitrum’s grant in the context of LTIPP. 

The post doesn’t constitute a concrete proposal but rather as a conversation starter to collect feedback and input from delegates.


### **[RFC] AlphaGrowth - Growing Uniswap through Incentives, Distribution, and Co-Marketing**

Building on the discussion post described above, AlphaGrowth [published an RFC](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-alphagrowth-growing-uniswap-through-incentives-distribution-and-co-marketing/24578) that dives deeper into the concept of establishing a dedicated entity within the DAO to be in charge of utilizing grants and incentives from different ecosystems where Uniswap is deployed. The post is a high-level discussion and doesn’t propose something specific.


### **[RFC] - Hedge against Impermanent Loss**

Marek from Carmine Finance [published an RFC](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-hedge-against-impermanent-loss/24562) that seeks to discuss the concept of introducing a hedge against impermanent loss (IL). At this time, the post is more of a discussion and less of a proposal and seeks the community’s feedback on a mechanism to hedge against IL that is described in the post.


### **Uniswap Delegate Reward Initiative - Cycle 3 Discussion**

Following the successful passing of the Delegate Rewards Initiative for a second cycle, Doo from StableLabs [published a post](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-delegate-reward-initiative-cycle-3-discussion/24577) to open the floor for different ideas, suggestions, as well as concerns. Specifically, any case studies, theories or data would be quite helpful to the discussions.


### **August ‘24 Uniswap Report**

Oku [published](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/august-24-uniswap-report/24588) the most recent issue of the Uniswap Monthly Report, summarizing protocol metrics for August 2024

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

We’re interested in discussing the topic of leveraging incentives and grants in other ecosystems to better understand if it’s worth spending time and effort on it.

Prospective applicants must fill in their application following the instructions outlined in the thread. Applications will remain open for at least seven days, but an application deadline isn’t specified.
