### **Governor Update Proposal: Removing Abstain Count from Quorum**

Agora [created a proposal](https://gov.optimism.io/t/governor-update-proposal-removing-abstain-count-from-quorum/10052) asking delegates to approve a one-line tweak to the Optimism Governor: exclude Abstain votes from quorum math. Currently, every Abstain increases the ‚Äúvotes cast‚Äù total, which ironically lowers the Yes/No threshold and can tip the outcome. The patched contract‚Äîalready deployed, audited by Trust, and carrying no state changes‚Äîcounts only 'Yes' and 'No' toward quorum, keeping 'Abstains' truly neutral. If governance signs off, the Foundation will point the proxy to the new implementation with zero downtime.


### **Collective Year 3 Budget Update and Year 4 Budget Outlook**

The Optimism Foundation‚Äôs new budget post [shows](https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-year-3-budget-update-and-year-4-budget-outlook/10057/1) Year 3‚Äôs 229.9 M OP spend paying off: Superchain share leapt to 68 %, TVL hit $5.5 B, and protocol fees reached 17,756 ETH on the back of Base and OP Mainnet. With 91% of Retro Funding still unspent, the Foundation requests no new tokens for Year 4‚Äîjust 51-81M OP from the existing Ecosystem Fund. The lion‚Äôs share (25-50M OP) targets new chains and infra, 18M OP shores up the core stack, and 5-10M OP fuels user incentives, all aimed at making Superchain interoperability ubiquitous before July 2026. An ROI dashboard is expected to be released in Q4 2025, with a mid-year check-in scheduled for this December. Dive into the post for full tables and Budget Board notes.


### **Season 8 Developer Advisory Board Charter Amendment**

Wildmolasses [proposes](https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-8-developer-advisory-board-charter-amendment/10053) a v1.4 rewrite that upgrades the Developer Advisory Board from sounding board to engine room. The new charter makes the DAB the primary gate for protocol upgrades‚Äîan optimistic 5-of-7 DAB vote now green-lights any change unless stakeholders intervene‚Äîand grants it complete control of ‚ÄúDeveloper Adoption Grants,‚Äù allowing it to fund audits, missions, and tooling on its terms. Board mechanics are tightened as well: at least seven independent members, Joint-House elections, and new conflict-of-interest rules that ban core developers and long-term grantees. Terms stretch to 12 months, covering Seasons 8-9, and all Season 7 cruft is stripped out.


### **Season 8 Milestones and Metrics Council Charter**

PGov [proposes](https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-8-milestones-and-metrics-council-charter/10050) a light-touch revamp that locks the M&M Council into Season 8‚Äôs governance plumbing. The charter now outlines a 5-of-7 multisig (4 M&M reviewers, 2 Grants-Council representatives, 1 DAB seat) and includes a ‚ÄúSigning Actions‚Äù checklist for weekly OP disbursements and grant-close payouts. The wording is reshuffled to match the new Foundation template, but the council size (lead + 3 reviewers), stipends, and retroactive bonuses remain mostly intact. Budget tweaks flagged for later: a small line item to keep the grants-claiming tool alive, funds for a data-dashboard build-out, and a baked-in ‚Äúbridge‚Äù stipend so reviewers can cover the gap between seasons.


### **S7 Grants Council Impact Analysis**

The Optimism Foundation, working with Open Source Observer, [tallied up](https://gov.optimism.io/t/s7-grants-council-impact-analysis/10055) Season 7‚Äôs 17 TVL-focused grants (20 Mar ‚Äì 12 Jun). The cohort attracted $65.3M in new Superchain deposits‚Äîapproximately $1.58, $3.67, and $9.39 of net TVL per OP at the 25th, median, and 75th percentiles. Morpho-World ($44 / OP) and Euler ($24 / OP) top the chart, while Aerodrome and Uniswap pair solid inflows with the highest volume-to-TVL ratios, a signal that their liquidity may stick around. These benchmarks will steer Season 8 grant picks toward fatter returns.


### **Futarchy v1 Preliminary Findings**

Elizaoak [reported](https://gov.optimism.io/t/futarchy-v1-preliminary-findings/10062) that Optimism‚Äôs first Futarchy contest drew 430 real forecasters (after weeding out 4,122 bots) who made 5,898 trades with OP-PLAY tokens during Season 7. Against the Grants Council‚Äôs parallel round, Futarchy picked two of the same grantees and three different ones‚Äîand those three drove $32.5 M more Superchain TVL after 84 days, thanks mainly to its outlier bet on Balancer & Beets. The flip side: predictions overshot reality by roughly $200, and the variance was wider. Futarchy snagged both the best and the worst performers. Lesson learned: markets can spot moon-shots, but real-stakes incentives and tighter sybil controls are needed for sharper forecasts. V2 will test ‚Äúskin-in-the-game‚Äù rewards, bigger sample sizes, and cleaner outcome metrics before Futarchy takes on more Collective decisions.

### **AIP: Disable Legacy Tether Bridge**

The Arbitrum Foundation [proposes](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/constitutional-aip-disable-legacy-tether-bridge/29503) discontinuing the old USDT bridge, now that the faster, OFT-based USDT0 route has been live since January. Leaving the legacy bridge in place forces seven-day withdrawals and can strand smart-contract deposits; a single DisableGatewayAction call (already audited) will instead cause any legacy deposit to revert instantly. If the Snapshot vote clears the 3 % quorum, the change will bundle into July/August‚Äôs upkeep vote on Tally and take effect one week after execution.


### **Proposal: Institutional $ARB Buyback via Bond Issuance**

Espressoguy [created a proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-institutional-arb-buyback-via-bond-issuance/29491) with the idea that the Arbitrum DAO should act like a blue-chip treasurer: float zero-coupon convertible bonds with an institutional partner, then use the proceeds to scoop up $ARB on the open market. Most of the repurchased tokens would be burned, thereby tightening the 5 B-token float; a slice could be set aside in reserve for future incentives. The pitch mirrors MicroStrategy‚Äôs February debt raise. It aims to swap idle, $1.3 B-plus treasury assets for sustained buy-side demand‚Äîsending a loud ‚Äúwe‚Äôre long ARB‚Äù signal without immediate interest costs.


### **Proposal: Establishing the Arbitrum Ecosystem Fund**

Crypto_Lilia [created a post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-proposal-establishing-the-arbitrum-ecosystem-fund/29513https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-proposal-establishing-the-arbitrum-ecosystem-fund/29513) aimed at seeding a VC-run fund that backs builders on Arbitrum. Under the plan, the DAO would park part of its treasury with a top venture firm; the new vehicle would mix token grants, equity checks, and pilot-program financing across infra tools, DeFi, RWAs, gaming, and NFTs. Similar funds on Avalanche, Base, and Solana are cited as evidence that the model is effective. Goals: speed up product launches, diversify the app stack, and create steady buy-side demand for ARB as teams vest and spend their tokens.

## **Uniswap**


### **[RFC] Nibiru Application for Canonical Uniswap V3 Deployment**

The Nibiru Foundation, with technical support from GFX Labs, [has filed](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-nibiru-application-for-canonical-uniswap-v3-deployment/25677) an RFC asking the Uniswap DAO to acknowledge the already-live v3 contract suite on the high-throughput, MultiVM Nibiru chain as an official ‚Äúcanonical‚Äù deployment. All contracts‚Äîfrom factory to router and NFT manager‚Äîare verified on-chain; the only DAO task is to add their addresses to v3-deployments.uniswap.eth. Nibiru‚Äôs 1.8 s blocks, EVM + Wasm support, and integrations with LayerZero, Stargate, and Hyperlane give Uniswap immediate access to cross-chain assets such as SyrupUSDC, oUSD, and uBTC, while planned front ends (Swify) and partners (LayerBank, Friendly, Ichi) aim to deepen liquidity and structured-product volume. No code changes or funding are requested‚Äîjust a governance nod to make the deployment official.

## **Starknet**


### **Introducing SN 0.13.6**

Ohad-StarkWare [announces](https://community.starknet.io/t/introducing-sn-0-13-6/115678) a config-only upgrade that swaps in the new S-Two Circle-STARK prover. Blocks that once took ~24 minutes to prove with Stone are now cleared in under three minutes, and proving costs are projected to decrease by at least 50%. To stay within S-Two‚Äôs trace limits, the release enables per-builtin resource counting and temporarily disables Cairo Native (planned return in Q3 after extra counting logic ships). Gas prices and limits remain unchanged, allowing developers to achieve faster, cheaper finality with no contract migrations required. Further S-Two-friendly tweaks‚Äîlike a new OS hash‚Äîare on the roadmap for v0.14.


### **SNIP 31: Bitcoin Staking on Starknet**

NatanSW [has created](https://community.starknet.io/t/snip-31-bitcoin-staking-on-starknet/115696) a proposal that introduces a native staking track for wrapped-BTC on Starknet: approved wrappers (WBTC, tBTC, LBTC, etc.) can be delegated to validators and earn STRK rewards, giving Bitcoin up to 20‚Äì25% of total staking power (Œ±). STRK stakers retain their current APR; BTC rewards originate from an additional 0.5% inflation headroom, increasing the theoretical cap to 2.1%‚Äîstill below the 4% ceiling. Safeguards include a 24-hour deposit delay and emergency delisting of compromised wrappers. Launch is targeted for Q3 2025, with Cairo contracts handling all logic on-chain.

## **Wormhole**


### **Hardhat Cross-Chain Simulator Plugin**

DappsoverApps [proposes](https://forum.wormhole.com/t/proposal-hardhat-cross-chain-simulator-plugin/827) a $ 27,000 grant to build a lightweight Hardhat plugin that simulates Wormhole cross-chain messaging locally. Instead of spinning up Tilt‚Äôs heavy Docker/Kubernetes devnet or hand-crafting VAAs, developers would add the plugin and call await relayVAA(tx), letting tests capture LogMessagePublished, mint a mock VAA with the Wormhole SDK, and deliver it to the target chain‚Äîall inside Mocha/Chai. Milestones run from July 31 to October 4, with six months of maintenance. Success targets include 100 npm installs and 10 public repositories using the tool within three months. The team argues the plugin will halve debugging time, unblock CI pipelines, and bring Hardhat parity with Foundry‚Äôs Pigeon simulator, advancing Wormhole‚Äôs cross-chain developer experience.

## **Scroll**


### **Scroll Governance AI Tooling Survey ‚Äì Results are out!**

Jamilya [shares the takeaways](https://forum.scroll.io/t/scroll-governance-ai-tooling-survey-results-are-out/894) from a delegate survey. Every respondent was a Scroll delegate, and they are most active in reading, voting, and writing rationales. Pain points: summarising long threads (83 %), tracking deadlines (75 %), and parsing proposals (58 %). Delegates want AI that summarizes discussions and proposals (83%), issues voting-window notifications (67%), and offers topic-based alerts‚Äîpreferably embedded in the forum. Ninety-two percent are ready to test early tools, but they reject automated rationales or ‚Äúset-and-forget‚Äù voting. A one-minute follow-up poll is open now to rank which AI prototypes the team should build first.
