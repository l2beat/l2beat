### **Season 8 and 9 Election Information**

The Optimism Foundation [laid out](https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-8-and-9-election-information/10081) the timeline for this season’s three votes—Grants Council, Developer Advisory Board, and Milestones & Metrics Council. Prospective candidates must review the relevant charter, create a self-nomination in OP Atlas, and post the link in the forum thread between July 3 and 14 (19:00 UTC cut-off). A three-day review window follows; delegates will cast ranked-choice votes in Atlas from July 17 to 23. 

According to the Representative Framework, one elected seat is allocated per person, and voters may support their candidacy as long as they complete the rest of the ballot. No Foundation-run town halls this round—community members can host their own.

## **Uniswap**


### **Discretionary Budget Thread**

The UAC [opened a standing forum thread](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/discretionary-budget-thread/25704) to disclose monthly use—­or non-use—­of its fast-action incentives purse. Rules: The committee can tap surplus UNI only when that surplus is at least 50% above the current balance, and any single discretionary programme is capped at $ 250,000. All five members must agree that a deal is “high-value.” 

June’s report shows zero spend: the Incentive Package account sits at 125k UNI (≈ $ 890k) with a surplus that lifts the adjusted balance to $1.95M, leaving $619k available for rapid-fire deployments unless UNI drops below the $1.34M buffer. Monthly updates will follow on the first of each month.

## **Polygon**


### **PIP: Full ERC-20 Functionality for Validator Share Tokens**

Pete Kim (Polygon Community Treasury Board) [proposed](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-full-erc-20-functionality-for-validator-share-tokens/21101) upgrading each validator’s “dPOL[ID]” share token from a non-tradable stub to a full ERC-20 token with “approve”, “transferFrom”, and EIP-2612 “permit” functionality. Once live, stakers could move or wrap their delegated POL just like any other token, making it trivial for third-party protocols to mint liquid-staking derivatives (sPOL/wsPOL) without custodial workarounds. The change preserves auto-claim-on-transfer logic, keeps decimals at 18, and requires only a proxy upgrade for existing ValidatorShare contracts. Unlocking even a fraction of the ≈ $670M currently staked could inject hundreds of millions in fresh collateral across Polygon PoS and Agglayer chains, while lowering the barrier to new staking and boosting network security.


### **Polygon Staking Report. June 2025 (By Validator.Info)**

June’s staking dashboard [shows](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/polygon-staking-report-june-2025-by-validator-info/21097) Binance Node leading with 422M POL, while Twinstake and Upbit sit at 342 M and 334 M. Everstake remains the crowd-favorite validator by wallet count, serving 4.2k delegators, and stakeFi Network tops self-stake at 1.66M POL. Binance Node also recorded the most significant monthly inflow, adding 121M POL, with two anonymous operators each picking up approximately 50M. Staking4all attracted the most new delegators (+30), and five validators—including Twinstake, Upbit, and Luganodes—posted flawless checkpoint uptime. For full block-production metrics and live dashboards, head to Validator.Info.

## **Everclear**


### **RFC - Governance Engagement Team Pilot Program**

Harryvors [suggested](https://forum.connext.network/t/rfc-governance-engagement-team-pilot-program/1383) a three-month test run for a two-person “Governance Engagement Team” to revitalize Everclear’s quiet forums. For 9,000 USDC (1,500 USDC per member per month), the duo would:



* Spark thread activity and nudge lurkers to comment,
* Publish three onboarding guides (“How to Contribute,” “Proposal Process,” etc.),
* Issue three governance-roundup posts, and
* Shepherd RFCs from draft to Snapshot.

Success is measured by a **20% jump in unique forum users and Snapshot wallets**. If those KPIs land, a follow-up vote could extend the program beyond the pilot.

[Should 100 million LSK of the DAO treasury be burned?](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/lisk/proposal/109529319231798472455931112461964493964262461314287853501160335464858704295202) - ends on July 15 at 13:46 UTC.


### **Lisk DAO Season 1 Report**

SuperchainEco [published](https://forum.lisk.com/t/lisk-dao-season-1-report/433/1) the final report of Lisk’s Season 1(Mar 10 – Jun 11 2025) where it was steered 3.5 M LSK in authorised funding but spent just 1.7 M, yet still hit all five socio-economic intents: hundreds of builders joined the Pioneer and acceleration programmes; TVL climbed from ≈ 5 M to 25 M, positioning Lisk as a Superchain liquidity hub; deployments from teams like RE7/Morpho and Mellow went live; and dashboards now track treasury data ahead of the pending LSK burn vote. Of the three budget lines—Builder Grants, Builder Programmes, and Ecosystem Incentives—only the liquidity push (Lisk Surge) remains active, having used 805k LSK so far. Roughly 1.8 M unspent LSK will return to the treasury by 31 July unless a Season 2 proposal (coming soon) wins approval.


### **Lisk DAO Season 2**

SuperchainEco [has published](https://forum.lisk.com/t/lisk-dao-season-2/449) a proposal requesting 2.3 M LSK—added to the 1.7 M left from Season 1—for Lisk DAO Season 2, a six-month program running until December 17, 2025. The 4M LSK budget would send 3.75M LSK directly to builders, incubators, an ambassador push, and on-chain incentives, all aligned with the identical four intents as last season: to make DAO participation rewarding, accelerate builders, grow non-LSK TVL, and boost Lisk’s revenue back to the Superchain. A Grants Council will disburse funds, while a Steering Committee tracks the impact; mid-season and final reports are scheduled for September 30 and December 22. Unused tokens revert to the treasury if the proposal fails.

## **ZkSync**


### **[TPP-Draft] ZKsync Security Council Bridge Funding**

The ZKsync Security Council [has filed](https://forum.zknation.io/t/tpp-draft-zksync-security-council-bridge-funding/718) a draft Token-Program Proposal, asking the Token Assembly to mint 10.87M ZK via a capped minter—enough to cover signer compensation and foundation overhead for June and July, while a longer-term funding model is finalized for August. Any undistributed tokens will be unminted after September 30, and the Assembly can cancel the minter at any point. An accountability report on emergency actions, governance approvals, and member SLA performance is promised at period-end.


### **[TPP-Draft] ZKSync Delegators Incentive Funding**

An unknown user [has published](https://forum.zknation.io/t/tpp-draft-zksync-delegators-incentive-funding/727) a proposal requesting 7.08M ZK to reward the protocol’s 59 largest delegators—those holding ≥ 10M voting power. Each would receive 20,000 ZK per month for six months, with every tranche locked for 40 days and contingent upon at least 80% voting participation. The goal is to recognize due diligence workloads, maintain high engagement, and strengthen decentralized governance without skewing power: missed participation cuts off future payouts.

## **Scroll**


### **Proposal: Community Council Formation**

Juansito [created a proposal](https://forum.scroll.io/t/proposal-community-council-formation/935) that asks for 2.71 M SCR to set up a five-member Community Council that will steer Local Nodes, grassroots events, and mini-grants for six months. The council’s work will align with four ongoing objectives: to keep participation rewarding, accelerate builder programs, increase non-LSK TVL through well-run nodes and incentives, and expand Scroll’s contribution to the Superchain.


### **Q3 2025 Goals – Scroll Governance Team**

Jamilya [outlined](https://forum.scroll.io/t/q3-2025-goals-scroll-governance-team/951) the team’s roadmap for July-September: operationally, they’ll launch the Governance Futures podcast, run a treasury-management RFP, keep the 500k-SCR auto-abstain wallet live, push a test timelock on Agora, and steer a third CCC org-design sprint. Regarding ecosystem growth, they plan to establish the seven-seat Ecosystem Growth Council, approve at least two funding initiatives, and onboard three new Local Nodes, while drafting a Global Community Council. Governance iteration items include rolling out a 7-week Delegate Accelerator, publishing a research agenda, finalizing a delegate event for Devconnect, implementing a new compensation model via the GCR working group, and proposing a Governance Iterations Council—all with progress reports due by September 30.
