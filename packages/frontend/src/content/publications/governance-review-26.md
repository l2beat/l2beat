## **Optimism**

Things are calm in Optimism during Voting Cycle 27, but Blockspace Charters has everyone’s mindshare.


### **Cycle 27 Intent 3A Mission Request and Sponsorship**

Gonna, the Grants Council lead, [created a thread](https://gov.optimism.io/t/cycle-27-intent-3a-mission-request-and-sponsorship/8807) to help everyone keep track of new Mission Requests in Cycle 27 and will create a similar thread for each new cycle. Anyone who creates a new Mission Request is asked to follow the steps outlined in the thread to help aggregate all Mission Requests in one place for convenience.

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

We are interested in discussing Blockspace Charters to hear the community’s opinion of them. Michael has [started a discussion](https://gov.optimism.io/t/govnft-governance-topic-thread-1/8822) that we’re keen to get deeper into.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss all of the above and more during our [Optimism Office Hours](meet.google.com/pem-jzrh-gkq) every Tuesday at 3 pm UTC.

### **Announcement: Whitelisted Providers for the ADPC Security Services Panel**

ImmutableLawyer [published a post on behalf of the ADPC](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/announcement-whitelisted-providers-for-the-adpc-security-services-panel/26544?u=immutablelawyer) to announce the first group of security service providers who have been whitelisted under the ADPC Security Services Panel and Procurement Framework.

### **[ARDC] August Update**

As the DAO Advocate for the ARDC, we (L2BEAT) [have published an update](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-dao-advocate-communication-thread/22865/11) on what the ARDC delivered during August and what workstreams are still being worked on. As a reference, the deliverables published by the ARDC during August were:

### **[RFC] Terms of Tenure for STEP Program Manager**

Devansh [submitted an RFC](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-terms-of-tenure-for-step-program-manager/26675/1) to seek the DAO’s input on the terms of tenure for the STEP program manager. Specifically, the original proposal had earmarked 100,000 ARB as payment to the program manager for one year (which was converted to $86,581), while Steakhouse quoted a fee of $174,000/year in their application.

The proposed solutions outlined in the RFC are to:



* Approve only a 6-month contract from available funds
* Earmark additional funds so they complete their one-year tenure
* Not have a program manager, which will result in the liquidation of the RWAs
* Conduct a new RFP to select a program manager for one year at $86,581


### **[RFC] Arbitrum Offsite format: online vs IRL**

Danielo [submitted an RFC](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-offsite-format-online-vs-irl/26629) that proposes organizing a dedicated off-site event in Q4 2024, focusing on strategic alignment and problem-solving sessions. The RFC is following up on a [successful temp check](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x21a4ec3fd338fa4eb2230d0e6131d1411639d94cf1b27864c9a3c1c722568c08), and it’s attempting to narrow down the event’s format rather than propose something concrete. 

The three options being explored are:


1. IRL event next to a major event (e.g., DevCon in Thailand)
2. Stand-alone IRL event
3. Online event

The current projected budget for facilitating the event is around $15,000, but that’s subject to change based on the DAO's decision. Under the proposal, delegates are encouraged to voice their opinions, questions, and concerns, as it should be an exploration.


### **[RFC] GovHack Core Series - Hack Humanity**

KlausBrave [submitted an RFC](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/govhack-core-series-hack-humanity/26634) to propose the GovHack Core Series, a series of three annual three-day events before DevCon, ETHDenver, and EthCC. The series is designed for 60-80 key stakeholders in the Arbitrum ecosystem. The total requested annual budget is $558,000.

Delegates are encouraged to review the [impact report from ETHcc’s GovHack](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/govhack-ethcc-brussels-2024-impact-report-hack-humanity/26530) to better understand the event's impact and associated costs.


### **[RFC] Synthetix LTIP Grant Extension Request**

MattL from Synthetix [published an RFC](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-synthetix-ltip-grant-extension-request/26524) that requests an 8-week extension for its LTIP grant to align with the launch of Perps Multi-Collateral and distribute 900k ARB in trading fee rebates. This extension will run from September 16th to November 16th, 2024.

Synthetix had originally received a 2,000,000 ARB grant, of which they have already distributed 1,100,000. With their extension request, they’re asking for the DAO's permission to utilize the remaining 900,000 ARB as trading fee rebates over the next eight weeks at a rate of 112,500 ARB per week. 


### **[RFC] Pyth Network Arbitrum LTIPP Extension Request**

KemarTiti [submitted an RFC](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-pyth-network-arbitrum-ltipp-extension-request/26533) that seeks a 12-week extension of Pyth Network’s LTIPP grant to November 30, 2024. Pyth had originally received 1,000,000 ARB, of which they’ve only distributed 75,042. With their proposal, Pyth requests the DAO’s permission to retain 174,958 ARB and continue distributing it over the next 13 weeks, bringing the total ‘spend’ to 250,000 ARB. The remaining 750,000 will be returned to the DAO’s treasury.


### **[RFC] Gyroscope LTIPP Grant Extension Request**

Jooooo5as [submitted an RFC](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-gyroscope-ltipp-grant-extension-request/26618) on behalf of Gyroscope seeking the extension of its LTIPP grant until October 2024 to ensure they have adequate time to distribute the remaining 20,000 ARB from the 100,000 ARB they originally received.


### **[Update] Liquidity Incentives Working Group**

Following the successful temp-check of the ‘Incentives Detox’ proposal, we (L2BEAT) have been facilitating the creation and recurring meetings of a working group that will focus on analyzing the lessons learned from all previous programs and eventually help design (a) new, more efficient, incentives program(s). The working group meets every Wednesday at 3 pm UTC at [this link](meet.google.com/jqp-ppsq-xnq).

The recordings and summaries from the previous calls are in [the thread here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-incentives-detox-proposal/25849/65).

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

We’d like to hear the community’s opinion on the two events-related proposals and what the DAO should do in response to the LTIPP extension requests, given the Incentives Detox proposal that passed a few weeks ago. 

**When/where to catch us:**

### **MATIC - POL Migration: Transparency Report**

Maxsam4 from Polygon [published a transparency report](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/matic-pol-migration-transparency-report/19703). After evaluating the efficacy, impact, execution specifications, and security considerations, the PC has reached a supermajority consensus of 10/13, thereby executing the change without timelock.


### **Agglayer list of developer resources**

Swader, DevRel at Polygon, [published a list of developer resources](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/agglayer-list-of-developer-resources/19692) for anyone interested in building on/for Agglayer. The list includes tutorials and explainers, developer tools, chain dev tools, and implementers.

### **The Incomplete Guide to Submitting a Proposal to the Everclear DAO**

As the Operations Officer of Everclear’s Governance Task Force (GTF), we (L2BEAT) have [published a guide](https://forum.connext.network/t/the-incomplete-guide-to-submitting-a-proposal-to-the-everclear-dao/1264) on how anyone can submit a proposal to Everclear’s DAO. Although not an official document, the guide provides useful information on the process of submitting a proposal for delegates to consider and a lot of ‘unofficial’ tips.


### **[RFC] EverClear Governance Analytics Dashboard**

Curia [published an RFC](https://forum.connext.network/t/rfc-everclear-governacne-analytics-dashboard/1263) proposing the development of the EverClear Governance Analytics Dashboard to support ongoing governance initiatives within the EverClear DAO, enhance transparency, and provide comprehensive insights into governance data.

Delegates can choose from two different ‘packages’ with different features, costing $26,000 or $37,000 as a ballpark figure, contingent on the complexity of aggregating and analyzing data across various blockchains.


### **Everclear Governance Task Force - Communication Thread Update**

SEEDGov, the Program Manager of Everclear’s GTF, [posted a status update](https://forum.connext.network/t/everclear-governance-task-force-communication-thread/1251/4) covering all the activities that GTF was involved in from August 19th to September 2nd.


### **Understanding Next Token Supply**

TommyR8 from Everclear Foundation [posted a response](https://forum.connext.network/t/understanding-next-token-supply/1256/12) to DAOPlomats' analysis of the NEXT token supply to provide additional information on the circulating supply, including specific numbers. By going through the thread, one can comprehensively understand $NEXT’s total and circulating supply.

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

The proposal to upgrade the Security Council and establish its election process is the most notable this week, and we’re eager to discuss it with other delegates and Everclear stakeholders. Additionally, we’d love to connect with any individuals or organizations planning to nominate themselves to be members of the Security Council.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss all the above and more during our [Everclear Office Hours](http://meet.google.com/twm-jafw-esn) every Friday at 3 pm UTC.

**Upcoming Events (Times in UTC)**

[Everclear Delegates Call](meet.google.com/vqi-tdhd-aaq) on 19.9 at 3:00 pm 


## **Wormhole**

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

Wormhole’s governance hasn’t seen any new developments over the last week. If you believe we might have missed something, please let us know. Regardless of any news, we’re interested in discussing it with other Wormhole delegates, so if that’s you, [shoot us a message](https://t.me/sinkas5). 


## **Lisk**

L2BEAT will slowly start getting involved in Lisk’s governance as delegates. That means we’ll also begin to include Lisk in our governance review from now on.


### **Lisk DAO constitution**

Mona [published a post](https://forum.lisk.com/t/lisk-dao-constitution/77) outlining Lisk DAO’s Constitution, a living yet lasting record of the DAO’s purpose, values, and decision-making processes. The Constitution was formulated through governance, and it can be altered through the same process.

Lisk is part of the [Superchain](https://www.superchain.eco/) and as such, is subject to Optimism’s [Law of Chains](https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-law-of-chains-v0-1/6514). That means that any proposal conflicting with the rules set forward in the Law of Chains will automatically be disregarded from Lisk’s governance process.

The Constitution provides comprehensive information on voting, the Security Council and its powers, the role of Onchain Foundation, the treasury and its financial breakdown, the kind of proposals, and the governance process and execution of proposals. 


### **Delegate to L2BEAT**

If you’re holding $LSK and want to delegate your voting power, you must stake it to receive $vLSK. You can stake your tokens on the [Lisk Portal](https://portal.lisk.com/), and then you can delegate the $vLSK you’ll receive [on Tally](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/lisk/delegate/l2beatcom.eth).

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

We’re fairly new to Lisk’s governance, and we’d love to meet other delegates and stakeholders so we can better understand the ecosystem's dynamics and needs. If you’re interested in chatting, please [shoot us a message](https://t.me/sinkas5).
