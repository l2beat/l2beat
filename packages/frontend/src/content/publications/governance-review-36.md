## **Optimism**


### **Introducing Soneium’s vision to the Optimism Collective**

Soneium [published a post](https://gov.optimism.io/t/introducing-soneium-s-vision-to-the-optimism-collective/9509) on the forum to announce the launch of their mainnet as part of the Superchain.


### **Season 7 Incentives Eligibility**

To support OP Chains, developers, builders, and the community in their efforts to progress towards Season 7’s intent, all incentive programs and the chain delegation program for Season 7 will be available to chains on a fully standard, governance-approved release of the OP Stack and have opted into the Security Council (or are on track to). 

For easy tracking, the Superchain Team has created an [ecosystem index](https://www.superchain.eco/superchain-index) that pulls data from the Superchain Registry, which serves as the source of truth to identify the OP Chains that are in the Superchain Ecosystem and what modifications they’ve made.


### **Optimism Collective Multisig Security Policy v1**

The Optimism Foundation [published a post](https://gov.optimism.io/t/optimism-collective-multisig-security-policy-v1/9541) announcing a policy that establishes a framework for operating and dissolving Council-managed multisignature wallets (multisigs) within the Collective. It establishes specific standards for Councils that secure and operate multisigs, to improve oversight, security, and accountability.

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

We’re interested in discussing anything related to the changes for Season 7 with other delegates and stakeholders, and we’re also interested in chatting with people who are building projects or chains on Optimism.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss all of the above and more during our [Optimism Office Hours](http://meet.google.com/pem-jzrh-gkq) every Tuesday at 4 pm UTC.

## **Polygon**


### **Community Grants Program: Season 2 Strategy**

Pete from the Community Treasury Board (CTB) [published a post](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/community-grants-program-season-2-strategy/20502) to announce the second season of the Polygon Community Grants Program (CGP) and its strategy. The program will include two key tracks: Independent Grant Allocators (GAs), responsible for distributing 15 million POL, and a Direct Track, managed by the Community Treasury Board (CTB), with up to 20 million POL available.

Season 2 will be focused on accelerating ecosystem growth by supporting projects focused on AI applications, DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks), memecoins, and novel experiments.

Pete also published two additional posts that go more in-depth on each of the two tracks. You can find them here:



* [Direct Track](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/grants-season-2-overview-direct-track/20505)
* [Grant Allocator Track](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/grants-season-2-overview-grant-allocator-track/20504)


### **PIP-51: Set EOA account code**

Manav2401 from PolygonLabs [published a proposal](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-51-set-eoa-account-code/20513) to add a new transaction type that adds a list of [chain_id, address, nonce, y_parity, r, s] authorization tuples. For each tuple, write a delegation designator (0xef0100 ++ address) to the signing account’s code. 


### **PIP 56: Danelaw Hardfork**

Raneet from PolygonLabs [published a proposal](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-56-danelaw-hardfork/20511) that specifies the changes included in the Polygon PoS hard fork named Danelaw. The contents of this upgrade intend to fix an issue observed on Amoy after the rollout of the [Jorvik hardfork](https://github.com/maticnetwork/Polygon-Improvement-Proposals/blob/main/PIPs/PIP-53.md).


### **PIP 55: New span message type in heimdall**

Raneet from PolygonLabs [published a proposal](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-55-new-span-message-type-in-heimdall/20510) that seeks to mitigate an unwanted effect of Jorvik hardfork that caused several instances of heimdall nodes crashing. The upgrade is not backward compatible; hence, it will require a hard fork of the Heimdall network.

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

We’re interested in discussing the second season of the Polygon Grants Program with all the relevant stakeholders and brainstorming on how we can make it as successful as possible based on our experience with grant programs in other ecosystems.

In the first period, we saw a $120,000,000 TVL growth, which reflects a $90 TVL increase for each $1 spent on incentives in a total of 54 pools.
