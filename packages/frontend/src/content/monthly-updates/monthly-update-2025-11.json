The proposal **replaces** the current single-gas target model with a multi-tiered structure comprising six overlapping gas targets and longer adjustment windows. This change aims to stabilize L2 gas prices, reducing the impact of demand surges and lowering volatility during peak network activity. Simulations show this system could have reduced L2 gas fees by up to **129%** during recent congestion spikes.\n\nTo support this transition and curb spam, the minimum L2 base fee would be raised from **0.01 to 0.02** gwei. Offchain Labs also requests limited authority to adjust gas targets and adjustment windows within DAO-approved bounds for two years, governed by a new *ResourceConstraintManager* contract. If passed, these updates will enhance fee predictability, protect against sudden price hikes, and strengthen network scalability.",

Today, finance runs on siloed messaging rails (SWIFT, card networks, bank APIs, market settlement systems), creating high exception rates, multi-hop dependencies, and costly reconciliation. ZKsync Interop proposes a shared cryptographic fabric that enables institutions to **coordinate directly across chains,** payments, treasury, securities, and compliance, via verifiable, tamper-resistant messages.\n\nBy embedding interop into the architecture institutions already use, the model sidesteps the “standard adoption” chicken-and-egg, turning fragmented workflows into trust-minimized, end-to-end processes. The result: lower coordination costs, fewer errors, and clear avenues for ZK token utility via interop usage (authorization, settlement, attestations), moving from isolated chain value to a decentralized network economy."

The core idea is that when participants already wait for Ethereum finality (as in institutional and RWA flows), Ethereum can serve as the primary liquidity hub without requiring each L2 ecosystem to concentrate liquidity into a mandatory, general-purpose “home” chain.\n\nAtlas aims to reduce interoperability latency, so ZKsync-based chains can tap Ethereum liquidity with near-real-time settlement standards, changing the usual L1/L2 dynamics where ecosystems often replicate liquidity into bespoke hubs. In this model, specialized hubs and app-chains can still exist, but become optional value-adds rather than infrastructure necessities, helping extend Ethereum’s liquidity across an elastic network of ZK chains instead of rebuilding it from scratch."

Anyone can put it to the test by hacking the application and draining the funds locked in the rollup contract.\n\nAfter PRT-Honeypot v1 surfaced a liveness bug, a new [version](https://github.com/cartesi/honeypot/releases/tag/v3.0.0) has now been deployed on Ethereum mainnet, complete with the upgraded PRT v2 algorithm discussed above. A corresponding [pull request](https://github.com/l2beat/l2beat/pull/10017) is also under review to bring Honeypot back to the L2Beat rollups dashboard as a Stage 2 rollup."

The update adds support for Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) management through new ECALL functions and a dedicated shadow TLB region in memory, improving the fidelity and precision of the Cartesi Machine’s low-level execution model. Read more details on the PR [here](https://github.com/cartesi/machine-solidity-step/pull/83)."

Students will build a simple Beacon crowdfunding app to help measure how efficiently newcomers navigate Cartesi’s documentation, tooling, and asset workflows.\n\nBy implementing the backend logic, testing deposits, and emitting the final output when the goal is reached, they will generate valuable metrics for refining resources and onboarding, directly contributing to Cartesi’s continuous improvement efforts."
