          "content": "In a year-end [post](https://blog.arbitrum.foundation/arbitrum-in-2025-the-year-of-everywhere/), the Arbitrum Foundation claims institutional finance moved from trials to production on its stack, citing Robinhood’s tokenized equities rollout, RWA deployments with Franklin Templeton, WisdomTree, BlackRock, and Spiko. Overall, it continued its L2 lead by market share. They report 2.1B+ lifetime transactions, $20B+ total value secured, 100+ chains in flight, 1,000+ projects, and ~$600M in “ecosystem GDP.”\n\nOn DeFi/RWAs, they highlight stablecoin supply up ~82% to ~$8B, RWA value at $1.1B+ (≈18× YoY), major Aave/Uniswap footprints, active loans up ~109% to ~$1.5B, and DRIP-driven stablecoin growth since September.\n\nFinancially, the Foundation says margins topped 90% across four revenue streams, Timeboost generated $5M+ in seven months, Q4 gross profit is ~$6.5M (~$26M annualized), and the DAO holds $150M+ in non-native assets. Looking ahead to 2026, they position Arbitrum to “deepen the rails” for institutional adoption and broader tokenization, while noting that Robinhood plans to launch a dedicated chain using the Arbitrum stack."

According to the proposers, the release aligns with Ethereum’s Fusaka era while adding Arbitrum-specific changes: a MaxTxGasLimit of 32M (with an effective per-block ceiling of 64M without changing overall gas/second), instrumentation of the state transition function to track multiple resource types (a step toward multi-dimensional pricing), native token mint/burn support included but explicitly disabled on One and Nova, and several bug fixes. The package excludes Fusaka blob-market EIPs that don’t apply to Arbitrum’s architecture. Trail of Bits completed an external audit, and Nitro v3.9.3 introduced support ahead of mainnet rollout.\n\nThe same vote bundles gas-pricing changes that, they say, should reduce L2 fee spikes: multiple (higher) gas targets measured over multiple adjustment windows, authority for the aligned entity (Offchain Labs) to make gradual parameter tweaks, a higher long-term effective gas target (up to a 100 Mgas/s maximum), and an increase of the minimum L2 base fee from 0.01 to 0.02 gwei. Activation is scheduled for Thursday, January 8, 2026, at 17:00:00 UTC.",

The service covers managed provers and sequencers, high-throughput RPC, durable webhooks, observability, audits, and 24/7 SRE, while the institution retains governance keys and policy.\n\nInstitutions can define gas token, fee curves, MEV rules, access controls, and data-availability preferences; Matter Labs delivers high availability, seamless upgrades, incident response, and capacity planning. Native interoperability with Ethereum and other ZK Stack chains is built in, with optional privacy via Prividiums for sensitive workflows.\n\nDesigned for banks, FMIs, fintechs, exchanges, and large web platforms, the offering delivers tuned performance, compliance-ready controls, and enterprise integrations (SSO, SIEM/APM, GRC, data exports) without the cost of an in-house operations team. Typical use cases include treasury rails, intraday collateral and repo, cross-border payments, DvP/RvP settlement, and tokenized deposits. Engagements include requirements and SLO scoping, architecture design, deployment across dev/stage/prod, and steady-state operations under SLAs (uptime, RTO/RPO, change windows) with full audit logs and signed releases."

In total, 227,078 OP were approved from 1.71M OP requested, leaving 8,798.40 OP in the Season 8 audit-grants budget after prior cycles. Fourteen applications were rejected this round.\n\nThe council says budget constraints shaped decisions despite strong demand. They note AI-assisted triage and that reviews **prioritize** open-source, Superchain-aligned projects with clear impact, co-funding, realistic OP-to-scope ratios, and underfunded audits. Next steps: the four approved teams proceed to funding; others were declined mainly due to budget exhaustion or cost/runway concerns.",

Current capacity is ~1,400 TPS on a path to 5,000, with improved uptime and observability, and Ethereum’s “Fusaka” EIPs activated for stronger security.\n\nNo action is required from users or developers; full-node operators should upgrade to the latest release."

Merchants get fast, low-cost settlement without banking hours, enterprise-grade reliability, and seamless access to the broader Ethereum ecosystem while keeping fees predictable.\n\nThe integration reinforces Polygon’s role as a payments infrastructure used by real businesses, not just crypto natives. Stablecoins are moving from trading floors into checkout lines, powering merchant payouts, global settlements, and round-the-clock liquidity. With Shift4 on board, Polygon advances its position as the preferred network for everyday money movement, where speed, uptime, and scale matter most."

The goal is to move beyond the rigid, programmatic incentives that jump-started restaking and early AVS launches, toward a more flexible system that rewards productive stake and drives organic AVS yield.\n\nThe council would manage allocation of emissions, keep rewards distribution responsive, and support EigenCloud growth with clear governance accountability.

On subsidized stake, the committee proposes a 20% fee on AVS rewards flowing to a fee contract for buybacks, and 100% of EigenAI, EigenCompute, and EigenDA cloud fees (after operator costs) going to the same contract.\n\nThe mandate includes reducing rewards to idle stake, prioritizing fee-paying AVSs and slashable or redistributable stake, and gaining the agility to reallocate emissions without repeated contract upgrades; total emission caps would remain under Protocol Council control. If ratified, the rollout will proceed in two steps: forming the committee, then shipping its first policy changes, with an early focus on attracting capital to live, fee-generating AVSs and bootstrapping apps on EigenCloud.",

The suite runs two modes—exact historical blocks and “merged” super-blocks that stitch 100 consecutive blocks into ~1.1 GGas payloads (peaking near 2 GGas)—to surface execution bottlenecks relevant to future higher gas limits and L2-scale batches.\n\nOn modest hardware, Nethermind reports leading throughput on real-mainnet replays at a mean 697 MGas/s and widening its lead under merged loads, outpacing others by roughly 2x to 10x; Reth showed degradation on larger blocks, with an identified issue pending retest.\n\nBeyond headline numbers, the framework’s fixed inputs and quick reset loop make performance gains measurable and repeatable for client teams and L2s alike, enabling tuning against real mainnet state or their own chain state. The authors outline next steps, including testing different slot times, larger and newer block ranges, and expanding client coverage, all to prepare Ethereum execution for a GigaGas future where stability, throughput, and predictable finality are the bar, not the bonus."

The report highlights practical uses such as KYC and AML verification, proof of reserves for custodians, and scalability through ZK rollups, with real activity from central bank research and major exchanges, plus builders like Starknet, Taiko, Intmax, ZKsync, and Aztec.\n\nThe paper also flags open hurdles, including uneven legal recognition, the need for common standards, and careful handling of regulated disclosures. Its recommendation is coordinated work across banks, regulators, and technology providers, alongside ongoing hardware and software improvements. Institutions that engage early position themselves to protect client assets, streamline compliance, and capture the next wave of digital finance innovation."
