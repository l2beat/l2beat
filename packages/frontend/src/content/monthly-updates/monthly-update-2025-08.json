Developed under the[ Kona suite](https://rollup.yoga/), this release offers an alternative to the traditional `op-node` by leveraging Rust’s memory safety and lightweight footprint. Unlike the original Go-based implementation, kona-node introduces an actor-based architecture, built on the `RollupNodeService` trait. This enables clearer developer interfaces and enhanced extensibility, especially for those integrating custom fault-proof systems. It supports multiple ZK backends (including FPVM, SP1, and Risc0) and is already live against OP Sepolia."
