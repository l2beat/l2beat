Season One is now live and focuses on leveraged looping on lending platforms.\n\nBy borrowing ETH or stablecoins against eligible yield-bearing assets (like syrupUSDC or weETH), users earn ARB based on their time-weighted average borrow. No signup needed—just loop, borrow, and earn over 10 epochs until January 20, 2026.\n\nRewards are protocol-agnostic, with a phased rollout to optimize incentives based on market performance.

This Constitutional AIP aims to upgrade Arbitrum One and Nova ahead of Ethereum's Fusaka hard fork (expected in November 2025), adding compatibility and unlocking powerful new features.\n\nKey changes include:\n\n- Fusaka EIP support like EIP-2537 (BLS12-381 precompile), EIP-7951 (secp256r1), and EIP-7825 (gas limit caps)\n- A new Native Mint/Burn feature for Orbit chains (disabled on One/Nova)\n- Support for constraint-based gas metering (for future dynamic pricing)\n- RPC enhancements, new opcodes, ModExp security hardening, and more\n\nMost notably, the release also introduces a more flexible block gas model, allowing higher transaction packing efficiency without increasing overall gas throughput.\n\nThe on-chain vote is not live yet, but is expected soon. If passed, the upgrade will roll out post-audit and testing - potentially after Ethereum activates Fusaka.",

The proposal, authored by the ZKsync Foundation, introduces a 100M ZK token prize pool to reward the first 10 production-ready Prividium Chains with 10M ZK each. Key features include: * **Strict eligibility**: KYB verification, mainnet launch by Dec 2026, and real-world traction (e.g. ≥500K KYC users or $100M+ in tokenized TVS). * **Controlled disbursement**: Each prize is rate-limited (1M ZK/month) via individual capped minters. Unused tokens remain unminted. * **Strategic alignment**: Incentivizes institutional deployments of privacy-enabled chains with on-chain governance, KYC/AML, and Ethereum finality. * **Testbed for future funding**: Prividium also serves as a pilot for conditional incentive models like milestone-driven rewards or performance-indexed grants.
