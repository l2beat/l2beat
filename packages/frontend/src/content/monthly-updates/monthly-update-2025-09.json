Season One is now live and focuses on leveraged looping on lending platforms.\n\nBy borrowing ETH or stablecoins against eligible yield-bearing assets (like syrupUSDC or weETH), users earn ARB based on their time-weighted average borrow. No signup needed—just loop, borrow, and earn over 10 epochs until January 20, 2026.\n\nRewards are protocol-agnostic, with a phased rollout to optimize incentives based on market performance.

This Constitutional AIP aims to upgrade Arbitrum One and Nova ahead of Ethereum's Fusaka hard fork (expected in November 2025), adding compatibility and unlocking powerful new features.\n\nKey changes include:\n\n- Fusaka EIP support like EIP-2537 (BLS12-381 precompile), EIP-7951 (secp256r1), and EIP-7825 (gas limit caps)\n- A new Native Mint/Burn feature for Orbit chains (disabled on One/Nova)\n- Support for constraint-based gas metering (for future dynamic pricing)\n- RPC enhancements, new opcodes, ModExp security hardening, and more\n\nMost notably, the release also introduces a more flexible block gas model, allowing higher transaction packing efficiency without increasing overall gas throughput.\n\nThe on-chain vote is not live yet, but is expected soon. If passed, the upgrade will roll out post-audit and testing - potentially after Ethereum activates Fusaka."

However, not all proposed changes received equal community support.\n\nSnapshot Outcome Highlights:\n\n- Approved by the DAO:\n    - Extend cohort terms from 1 year to 2 years, reducing election frequency.\n    - Allow Security Council members to rotate their keys during their term.\n    - Lower the qualification threshold from 0.2% to 0.1% of votable ARB.\n- Under Further Review:\n    - Less support for allowing key rotation during the election cycle.\n    - Less support for letting reapplying members skip the nomination phase.\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation announced plans to host additional governance calls to discuss these debated points before the formal Tally on-chain vote is proposed."

The proposal, authored by the ZKsync Foundation, introduces a 100M ZK token prize pool to reward the first 10 production-ready Prividium Chains with 10M ZK each. Key features include: * **Strict eligibility**: KYB verification, mainnet launch by Dec 2026, and real-world traction (e.g. ≥500K KYC users or $100M+ in tokenized TVS). * **Controlled disbursement**: Each prize is rate-limited (1M ZK/month) via individual capped minters. Unused tokens remain unminted. * **Strategic alignment**: Incentivizes institutional deployments of privacy-enabled chains with on-chain governance, KYC/AML, and Ethereum finality. * **Testbed for future funding**: Prividium also serves as a pilot for conditional incentive models like milestone-driven rewards or performance-indexed grants. This is the first program of its kind to embed governance-aligned token incentives into ZKsync’s institutional roadmap."

Led by the ZKsync Foundation, the program aims to convert institutional awareness into adoption by positioning ZKsync Prividium as the go-to blockchain solution for privacy, compliance, and interoperability.

          "content": "Nethermind’s Formal Verification team [has completed](https://www.nethermind.io/blog/we-verified-the-verifier-a-first-for-zero-knowledge-proof-systems) the first-ever formal proof of honesty for a live on-chain zk-verifier, working in collaboration with Matter Labs. Using EasyCrypt, they verified that ZKsync’s Yul-based verifier behaves exactly as intended, marking a milestone for formal methods in the ZK space. The effort highlights the critical role of secure verifiers in rollups and sets a precedent for future verification of zero-knowledge infrastructure."

Built on the SP1 zkVM, the oracle enables cryptographic validation of validator balance changes on-chain—particularly during negative rebases.\n\nThe audit uncovered two critical issues: potential manipulation via invalid validator indices and inconsistent state validation checks. Both were swiftly resolved by Lido. This verification logic ensures accurate state transitions and strengthens Lido’s move toward ZK-based trustless infrastructure."
