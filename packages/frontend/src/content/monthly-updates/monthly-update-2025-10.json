Now active across upgraded ZK Chains like Era, Abstract, and Sophon, V29 cuts block times down to 200ms while enabling new capabilities that strengthen interoperability and improve real-time performance.\n\nThis upgrade introduces native Interop Messaging between ZK Chains through the ZK Gateway.  Using Merkle proofs and a shared root structure, chains can now communicate securely and natively, setting the stage for seamless cross-chain applications.\n\nIt also implements Fast Finality, allowing ZK Chains to confirm transaction execution on Ethereum L1 earlier than before. This mechanism is especially important for centralized exchanges and time-sensitive use cases that rely on predictable finality guarantees.\n\nUnder the hood, V29 delivers foundational code improvements, including modular settlement support through a refactored **ChainAssetHandler**, and introduces an upgradable **ValidatorTimelock**, enhancing flexibility for future protocol upgrades.\n\nSecurity remains tightly scoped: pre-commitments in the finality system are only reversible by the ZKsync Security Council, and all components were audited by OpenZeppelin between May and June 2025."

          "content": "Collective Memory, a decentralized social network, [enables users](https://blog.eigencloud.xyz/how-collective-memory-uses-eigenai-to-verify-1-6m-war-photos-protests-and-party-pics-onchain/) to upload unfiltered images and videos, ranging from protests and wars to parties and daily life, called “Memories.” These are not just content but verifiable onchain assets. Each Memory can be staked into using ATTN tokens, allowing creators to earn and fans to invest in the truth they value.\n\nThe challenge was processing 1.6 million Memories at scale without relying on centralized AI, which contradicts their core principle of decentralization. To solve this, they integrated EigenAI, a service built on EigenCloud that ensures inference (like time, location, and context detection) is verifiable, tamper-proof, and free from centralized control.\n\nEigenAI orchestrates multiple open-source AI models and provides a transparent infrastructure for inference. It ensures that all prompts, models, and outputs are verifiable, which was essential for Collective Memory’s vision of a decentralized and trustworthy knowledge base.\n\nSince integrating EigenAI, the platform has significantly improved the transparency and trust of its verification process. It laid the foundation for a new internet-native, user-owned knowledge graph, which the founders describe as “the world’s verified reality graph.”"

          "content": "Witness Chain [introduces](https://blog.eigencloud.xyz/verifying-the-physical-world/) a cryptographically verifiable Proof of Location (PoL) system designed for decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN). Unlike traditional GPS or Wi-Fi-based systems vulnerable to spoofing, Witness Chain uses network latency between distributed “watchtowers” to verify that a device is physically located where it claims to be. This verification enables onchain enforcement of location-sensitive actions, such as jurisdictional compute, localized energy trading, and geo-fenced storage.\n\nBy integrating with EigenCloud as an Autonomous Verifiable Service (AVS), Witness Chain benefits from Ethereum-grade trust, decentralization, and slashing-based security. EigenLayer stakers act as challengers, verifying location claims through latency checks and earning rewards for honest participation. The result is a scalable, cryptoeconomically secure location layer for smart contracts and DePIN coordination."

          "content": "FereAI is a crypto assistant platform focused on long-horizon, AI-driven trading and research. It serves thousands of daily users with real-time intelligence by processing onchain activity, market news, and social signals. However, it faced a key limitation in AI: non-deterministic behavior. Identical prompts often yielded different outputs, posing a significant risk when managing real capital and long-term strategies.\n\nTo solve this, FereAI [integrated](https://blog.eigencloud.xyz/how-fereai-uses-eigenai/) with EigenAI, a verifiable inference service by EigenCloud. EigenAI ensures deterministic outputs from large language models (LLMs), meaning the same prompt always yields the same response — even with tool calls. This guarantees auditability and reproducibility and eliminates the need for complex guardrails.\n\nWith EigenAI, FereAI was able to scale faster, ship features more confidently, and provide trustworthy agent actions. Their developers can now focus on innovation instead of debugging unpredictable model outputs. For trading, where consistency is non-negotiable, this deterministic infrastructure turns experimental AI agents into reliable, production-grade financial tools."

It received unanimous support following a full security audit by Sigma Prime. While some complexity risks were noted around the stake transporter, a decentralization roadmap and controls were deemed adequate.\n\n**ELIP-010 (Mailbox for Hourglass)** standardizes task coordination for task-based AVSs. Reviewers praised its modular design and potential to expand viable AVS types. A minor spam attack vector was flagged but considered manageable. Final approval was conditional on audit completion, which is now public.\n\n**ELIP-011 (Programmatic Incentives v2.0)** updates EIGEN staking parameters to enhance rewards. It was described as simple and low-risk, with only one council member abstaining from the vote.\n\nThese approvals mark significant progress for EigenLayer's cross-chain operability, developer experience, and incentive alignment.",

Nethermind plays a major role, both implementing and co-authoring key EIPs that shape the upgrade.\n\nAmong their contributions:\n\n- EIP-7642 improves sync efficiency by eliminating unnecessary bloom filters.\n- EIP-7883 & EIP-7823 adjust gas costs to close attack vectors.\n- EIP-7934 & EIP-7935 increase block size and gas limits safely.\n- EIP-7939 adds the CLZ opcode, lowering ZK proof costs significantly.\n\nFusaka also introduces PeerDAS (EIP-7594) to expand blob capacity, making rollups cheaper and faster, and EIP-7918 to keep blob fees economically healthy.\n\nFor users and developers, changes like EIP-7917 (deterministic proposer lookahead) and EIP-7825 (congestion resistance) bring better performance and predictability.\n\nWith Fusaka, Ethereum strengthens every layer of its stack — and Nethermind ensures it's battle-ready for production."

The approach greatly reduces the delay that a well-funded attacker - even a multimillionaire - could impose from an estimated 106 weeks down to 22 weeks, while still keeping validation costs minimal for honest participants. The bond system makes claims modestly expensive to mitigate Sybil and delay attacks, and helps ensure dispute costs are covered without acting as a participation incentive. The upcoming Honeypot release will include this bond design for further testing under adversarial conditions.\n\nThe PRT prototype now also supports applications that use the [revert feature](https://github.com/cartesi/dave/pull/194) of the Cartesi Machine, enabling more realistic testing conditions. These improvements will be exercised in the upcoming Honeypot [release](https://github.com/cartesi/honeypot/releases/tag/v3.0.0-rc1)."
