Each Memory can be staked into using ATTN tokens, allowing creators to earn and fans to invest in the truth they value.\n\nThe challenge was processing 1.6 million Memories at scale without relying on centralized AI, which contradicts their core principle of decentralization. To solve this, they integrated EigenAI, a service built on EigenCloud that ensures inference (like time, location, and context detection) is verifiable, tamper-proof, and free from centralized control.\n\nEigenAI orchestrates multiple open-source AI models and provides a transparent infrastructure for inference. It ensures that all prompts, models, and outputs are verifiable, which was essential for Collective Memory’s vision of a decentralized and trustworthy knowledge base.\n\nSince integrating EigenAI, the platform has significantly improved the transparency and trust of its verification process.

EigenAI ensures deterministic outputs from large language models (LLMs), meaning the same prompt always yields the same response — even with tool calls. This guarantees auditability and reproducibility and eliminates the need for complex guardrails.\n\nWith EigenAI, FereAI was able to scale faster, ship features more confidently, and provide trustworthy agent actions. Their developers can now focus on innovation instead of debugging unpredictable model outputs. For trading, where consistency is non-negotiable, this deterministic infrastructure turns experimental AI agents into reliable, production-grade financial tools."

It received unanimous support following a full security audit by Sigma Prime. While some complexity risks were noted around the stake transporter, a decentralization roadmap and controls were deemed adequate.\n\n**ELIP-010 (Mailbox for Hourglass)** standardizes task coordination for task-based AVSs. Reviewers praised its modular design and potential to expand viable AVS types. A minor spam attack vector was flagged but considered manageable. Final approval was conditional on audit completion, which is now public.\n\n**ELIP-011 (Programmatic Incentives v2.0)** updates EIGEN staking parameters to enhance rewards. It was described as simple and low-risk, with only one council member abstaining from the vote.\n\nThese approvals mark significant progress for EigenLayer's cross-chain operability, developer experience, and incentive alignment.",

Nethermind plays a major role, both implementing and co-authoring key EIPs that shape the upgrade.\n\nAmong their contributions:\n\n- EIP-7642 improves sync efficiency by eliminating unnecessary bloom filters.\n- EIP-7883 & EIP-7823 adjust gas costs to close attack vectors.\n- EIP-7934 & EIP-7935 increase block size and gas limits safely.\n- EIP-7939 adds the CLZ opcode, lowering ZK proof costs significantly.\n\nFusaka also introduces PeerDAS (EIP-7594) to expand blob capacity, making rollups cheaper and faster, and EIP-7918 to keep blob fees economically healthy.\n\nFor users and developers, changes like EIP-7917 (deterministic proposer lookahead) and EIP-7825 (congestion resistance) bring better performance and predictability.\n\nWith Fusaka, Ethereum strengthens every layer of its stack — and Nethermind ensures it's battle-ready for production."

The key feature is the introduction of new view functions to help the node sync its state faster. The new functions help fetch the number of executed outputs and the number of accepted claims, available on the Application and Consensus interfaces, respectively. This release also bumps a few dependencies. Read the changelog [here](https://github.com/cartesi/rollups-contracts/releases/tag/v2.1.0-alpha.1)."

The root cause was an implementation-specific bug in the PRT smart contracts, not an algorithmic flaw in the fraud-proof system. While safety was preserved (no unauthorized withdrawals or incorrect settlements occurred), the flaw caused the application to permanently freeze, resulting in approximately $1,000 in Cartesi-owned funds being locked."

The approach greatly reduces the delay that a well-funded attacker - even a multimillionaire - could impose from an estimated 106 weeks down to 22 weeks, while still keeping validation costs minimal for honest participants. The bond system makes claims modestly expensive to mitigate Sybil and delay attacks, and helps ensure dispute costs are covered without acting as a participation incentive. The upcoming Honeypot release will include this bond design for further testing under adversarial conditions.\n\nThe PRT prototype now also supports applications that use the [revert feature](https://github.com/cartesi/dave/pull/194) of the Cartesi Machine, enabling more realistic testing conditions. These improvements will be exercised in the upcoming Honeypot [release](https://github.com/cartesi/honeypot/releases/tag/v3.0.0-rc1)."
