## **Optimism**

With Season 6 in full swing after Mission Requests were voted on, the Optimism Foundation is gearing up and preparing for Retro Funding round 5 and setting the stage for the elections of Cohort A of the Security Council.


### **Retro Funding 5: OP Stack - round details**

The Optimism Foundation [published a post](https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-5-op-stack-round-details/8612) announcing the details of Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) 5, which will reward contributors to the OP Stack, including core Ethereum infrastructure that supports or underpins the OP Stack, advancements in OP Stack research and development, and tooling which supports its accessibility and usability.

Applications for Retro Funding 5 will begin on the 15th of August and run for 2 weeks, while the results are set to come out on October 3rd.


### **Season 6: Security Council Elections - Cohort A**

Optimism Foundation [announced](https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-security-council-elections-cohort-a/8587) that they will be holding elections for Cohort A of the Security Council. The first election for Cohort A will take place during Voting Cycle #26, which starts on August 22nd and runs for a week. Candidates can post their nominations [in this thread](https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-security-council-nomination-thread-cohort-a/8588).


### **Retro Funding 5: Expert voting experiment**

Optimism Foundation [announced an experiment](https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-5-expert-voting-experiment/8613) for the voting design during Retro Funding 5. The hypothesis that round 5 aims to test is if experts make better OP allocation decisions on OP Stack contributions than non-experts since understanding the OP Stack’s different components requires a high degree of knowledge.

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

Establishing an elected security council is a very important step towards decentralizing the Optimism Collective, and we are very interested in discussing it with nominees and other delegates.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss all of the above and more during our [Optimism Office Hours](https://meet.google.com/pem-jzrh-gkq) every Tuesday at 3 pm UTC.

**Upcoming Events (Times in UTC)**

## **Arbitrum**

Arbitrum DAO keeps pushing forward in all directions, with the most prevalent discussions right now being the GCP council elections, the proposal by Entropy Advisors, and the discussion around different venture initiatives such as AVI and M&A.

### **Potential Misuse of Funds - Furucombo**

The Arbitrum Foundation published a post to notify the DAO that Furucombo seems to have misused 59,500 ARB from their STIP allocation. Following requests by the Foundation and StableLabs for Furucombo to return the funds, they haven’t returned any ARB despite agreeing to do so. As a result, the Foundation has created a [Snapshot poll](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x07bea6e32d32b4d3ed20faec6950c3546e2319bc2497716c53ee05995d4a00eb) to enable delegates to vote on whether or not they want to ban Furucombo from Arbitrum’s DAO.


### **[RFC] Incentives Detox Proposal**

We (L2BEAT) [submitted an RFC](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-incentives-detox-proposal/25849) proposing a three-month pause after the current incentives programs conclude on September 17th. We want to use the 3-month pause to facilitate a working group to analyze all the data we’ve collected from incentive programs so far and design a perpetual incentive program based on the learnings. This proposal doesn’t come at any cost or operational overhead to the DAO and it’s mostly a social consensus.


### **[RFC] Strategic Treasury Management on Arbitrum**

Karpatkey and Aera [submitted an RFC](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/strategic-treasury-management-on-arbitrum/25301) proposing the creation of Arbitrum Strategic Treasury Management Group and DAO Oversight Committee. The proposal starts with Strategic Treasury Management of 250M ARB assets under management, allowing the Group to manage ~2 years of runway. The proposal is extensive and very comprehensive, so we’d urge everyone to read it to understand it better.


### **[RFC] Diversification and Strategic Treasury Management on Arbitrum**

Avantgarde [has submitted an RFC](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/diversification-and-strategic-treasury-management-on-arbitrum/25579) complimentary to the one submitted by Karpatkey and Aera around diversification and treasury management of Arbitrum DAO’s treasury. This proposal, similar to the one by Karpatkey and Aera, is very comprehensive and worth reading to understand fully.


### **[RFC] Injection of funding to the Arbitrum Research and Development Collective**

ImmutableLawyer [submitted an RFC](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-injection-of-funding-to-the-arbitrum-research-and-development-collective/25676) that requests 1,200,000 ARB to be injected into the multisig responsible for compensating the members of the ARDC. The reason for the requested funds is that although the multisig was holding ARB, the compensation of the ARDC members was denominated in USD. With the recent negative price action of ARB, the multisig doesn’t hold enough ARB to cover the USD-denominated costs for the ARDC for the last 2 months of the engagement.


### **[RFC] ArbitrumDAO Off-site**

Danielo [submitted an RFC](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrumdao-off-site/25660) that proposes organizing a dedicated Arbitrum DAO 2-day off-site event during DevCon in Thailand in November. The focus of the off-site event is to gather high-context, expert, and senior participants for strategic alignment and problem-solving sessions.

The total ballpark cost for the proposal is $75,000-125,000 to cover event planning and coordination, travel and accommodation for the attendees, workshop facilitation, and post-event follow-ups.

### **Fractal ID Hack - Call for New KYC/KYB Service Provider Nominations**

Following a data leak of Fractal ID(KYC/KYB provider for the Arbitrum Foundation), [mcfly published a post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/fractal-id-hack-call-for-new-kyc-kyb-service-provider-nominations/25686) calling for immediate action toward finding a new KYC/KYB service provider to use through a procurement process. \
Stonecoldpat from Arbitrum Foundation [commented](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/fractal-id-hack-call-for-new-kyc-kyb-service-provider-nominations/25686/3) that they (the Foundation) are also actively looking to onboard alternative compliance providers.

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

After discussing with many people in Brussels during EthCC, we’re keen to go back to the drawing board regarding how we approach initiatives as a DAO. Right now, there doesn’t seem to be any overarching ‘mandate’ from the DAO towards a direction before a proposal spawns out of nowhere, hoping to tackle something that might have never been discussed in the context of the DAO. We had an idea of how we could change this kind of approach, but we’d be interested in discussing it further with other delegates and interested parties.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss all of the above and more during our [Arbitrum Office Hours](https://meet.google.com/jkj-nnop-arc) every Thursday at 3 pm UTC.

### **[RFC] Enhancing Uniswap Presence on Ethereum Layer-2s**

0xSocratic from DapDap [submitted an RFC](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/enhancing-uniswap-presence-on-ethereum-layer-2s/24189/1) that proposes to leverage their composable front-end to build an alternative Uniswap frontend and to collaborate with related DeFi projects to improve Uniswap’s market share, especially on emerging Ethereum L2s, or L2s where Uniswap is not the dominant DEX. The projected costs come at a total of 5,000 UNI for the development, deployment, and maintenance for 1 year per network and 5,000 UNI for user and business engagement strategies per network.


### **Uniswap Treasury Working Group (UTWG) Interim Update**

### **MATIC -> POL: Migration Coming September 4th**

H_Rooks, the Governance Lead at Polygon Labs, [announced](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/matic-pol-migration-coming-september-4th/18474) that on September 4th, POL will be replacing MATIC as the native gas and staking token for the Polygon PoS network.

## **Starknet**

Starknet makes the first step towards introducing staking.


### **SNIP 18: Staking’s First Stage on Starknet**

Nathan Granit from Starkware [submitted an SNIP](https://community.starknet.io/t/snip-18-staking-s-first-stage-on-starknet/114334) that seeks to introduce the first stage of staking. This SNIP aims for the first staking stage to be live on Starknet mainnet in Q4 2024, featuring a permissionless on-chain staking protocol and stake delegation. Staking would be enabled for stakers of an X amount of $STRK, where X is between 10k–100k $STRK. The proposal offers a comprehensive breakdown of the proposed approach to staking, and we’d suggest reading it to understand how it will work.

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

We’re very interested in discussing staking with other delegates or interested parties, especially stake delegation. If you have any thoughts to share, we’d like to hear them.
