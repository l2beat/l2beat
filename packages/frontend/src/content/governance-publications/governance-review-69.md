## **Optimism**


### **Interop Mission – Crosschain Alert Monitoring**

WakeUp Labs is [building a developer toolkit](https://gov.optimism.io/t/interop-mission-crosschain-alert-monitoring/10278) that sends test messages between OP Stack chains to create a steady “heartbeat,” then turns the results into clear health signals, latency, gas stats, and actionable alerts. It will ship as a TypeScript SDK plus services, enabling teams to identify cross-chain outages or slowdowns quickly and embed monitoring in their apps. The research phase is done; with the canonical messenger not yet live on mainnet/testnets, they’re using a temporary testnet relay while they move into the Tracking Module and share early SDK APIs. Long-term, they’ll maintain the repos and support users for at least two years.


### **Cycle 41 Grants Council Report**

Gonna.eth [shared the Cycle 41](https://gov.optimism.io/t/cycle-41-grants-council-report/10281) Grants Council update: one approval so far for 40acres.finance at 200,000 OP, 17 applications still under review, and one declined (Intraverse, 30,000 OP). Growth applications asked for about 2.97M OP this round, with 200,000 OP approved to date. Season 8’s budget is 6.29M OP, leaving roughly 6.09M OP. The council kicked off a continuous review so every submission received feedback, used a simple screening tool with a few cases bumped to human reviewers, and moved to Karma GAP/opgrants.io to make applying smoother. A milestone submission tool is on the way, and the council is starting cautiously to fine-tune incentives and invite stronger proposals.

## **Arbitrum**


### **Security Council Elections – Candidates Referral Bounties**

SEEDGov is [adding](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/security-council-elections-candidates-referral-bounties/29938) a straightforward referral perk for the Security Council election. If a DIP participant brings in a new candidate who reaches the Member Election phase, the participant earns 15 bonus points; if that candidate is elected, they earn another 15. The candidate must name the referring DIP participant in their forum post (Security Council Elections subcategory, tagged sep-2025-elections). Points are confirmed after compliance, and the final slate is tallied in October. No credit for self-nominations or re-running incumbents. A DIP participant can refer multiple candidates, but the reward is capped at 30 points per month. Voting for one’s own referrals is allowed.


### **The Arbitrum Foundation Bi-annual Progress Update (H1’2025)**

The Foundation [recaps a busy first half](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/the-arbitrum-foundation-bi-annual-progress-update-h1-2025/29931): 56 grants and partnerships across DeFi, gaming, infra, and Orbit; new programs like Trailblazer 2.0 and ArbiFuel; and expanded developer education at major events. On tech, Timeboost went live on One and Nova (over $2M in fees to the DAO), client diversity improved with Erigon and Nethermind, ArbOS Callisto prepped for Pectra, and BoLD progressed. Governance work included the March Security Council elections and stand-up of the OpCo (30M ARB over 30 months) with oversight via OAT. Ecosystem notes: Robinhood launched tokenized stocks on Arbitrum One, stablecoins topped $6B across Arbitrum chains, and 100+ Orbit chains opted into the stack. One thing to note, though, is that this report was published more than two months after the close of H1 2025. Hopefully, we can have these reports in a more timely manner in the future.


### **DRIP Season 1 Launch Recap**

Entropy [created a post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/drip-season-1-launch-recap/29921) that outlines the DRIP Season 1 launch recap. The program went live on Sept 3 and runs 20 weeks in ten two-week epochs with a 16M ARB base budget plus up to 8M ARB discretionary. Season 1 focuses on leveraging looping on Arbitrum One, rewarding borrowing against yield-bearing ETH and stable assets across participating lenders. It begins with a discovery month, transitions into a performance phase starting from epoch 3, and then tapers off at the end. Rewards are claimed via Merkl through Apr 30, 2026. Early results show roughly $70M in net-new eligible USD assets minted on Arbitrum, about $75M more USDC borrowed on eligible markets, and stronger DEX liquidity for the included stables. Entropy publishes public dashboards and may adjust participants or structure based on performance. Possible themes for Season 2 include RWAs, DEXs, and perps.


### **Arbitrum Curia Dashboard - Forum Activity Insights Are Live!**

Curia [created a post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-curia-dashboard-forum-activity-insights-are-live/29946) that outlines a new “Forum Activity Insights” upgrade to the Arbitrum Curia dashboard. It now tracks off-chain participation with views for engagement trends, active time, sentiment, and response rates, plus content performance for topics and posts. Delegates can unlock these sections by linking their forum account in the dashboard (connect wallet, verify forum). The aim is to capture contributions beyond on-chain votes; feedback is welcome.

## **Polygon**


### **Terra Dourada Architecture: A Proposal for High-Scalability Blockchain via Parallel Processing and ZK-Rollups**

Armando [created a post](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/terra-dourada-architecture-a-proposal-for-high-scalability-blockchain-via-parallel-processing-and-zk-rollups/21282) presenting “Terra Dourada,” a modular scaling idea for Polygon. It pairs a lightweight L1 for settlement (Terra) with a permissionless market of ZK-rollup provers (Golden Lands), a decentralized oracle and compute layer, and a separate data availability layer (Golden Storage). The goal is to achieve high throughput by running multiple mini-rollups in parallel and verifying a single proof on L1. DA utilizes erasure coding, sampling, and “Collective DA Verifiable Proofs” that anyone can verify. Provers win batches via auctions, and missing data or bad behavior can be challenged and slashed by contract. A centralized sequencer sets batch sizing and publishes competition stats, but is constrained by transparency rules and community-tunable metrics. A small proof of concept shows concurrent provers finalizing batches via a “reference semaphore” and a continuous aggregation pipeline. The author is asking for feedback on performance risks, DA integration, and the batch auction design.


### **Season 2 Grant Program Close-Out Framework**

Regan [created a post](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/season-2-grant-program-close-out-framework/21283) announcing that Polygon’s Community Treasury will close out Season 2 as it moves to Season 3. Season 2 involved 11 allocators managing about 10.5M POL across nearly 100 projects; roughly half the budget is deployed, 63 milestones are still pending, and only 2 allocators have fully finished. A hard deadline of October 31, 2025, now applies: all funds must be distributed, all milestone reviews and payments completed, and final documentation posted to the Forum. No rollovers are allowed; unspent capital must be returned, and partially completed work will be paid pro rata. Teams that miss the deadline will be marked non-compliant and may be ineligible for future funding. Direct-track milestone submissions are transitioning from Questbook to a new Polygon-managed form, with instructions provided by the Treasury team. After close-out, the Treasury will publish a consolidated Season 2 impact report and fully pivot to Season 3’s accountable growth model.

### **[TPP-Draft] ZKsync Prividium Roadshow**

Bendob [created a draft TPP](https://forum.zknation.io/t/tpp-draft-zksync-prividium-roadshow/775) that outlines a “Prividium Roadshow” to boost institutional awareness and deal flow for ZKsync Prividium through the end of 2026. The request is for 25M ZK (approximately $1.25M at $0.05/ZK) to be transferred from the Token Governor Timelock to a ZKsync Foundation 3-of-5 multisig. The plan splits spending into two tracks: 15M ZK for tier-1 conference sponsorships with speaking slots and branding, and 10M ZK for invite-only roundtables, workshops, and regulator briefings. Speakers would include Alex Gluchowski and senior BD, partner success, and engineering leaders from Matter Labs. Initial 2025 commitments list events like Blockchain Rio, Ethereum NYC, DAS London, SmartCon, and Devconnect; 2026 targets include KBW, ETHDenver, EthCC, CfC St. Moritz, and others. Matter Labs’ events team would front costs and be reimbursed from the multisig; travel and lodging are out of scope. The ZKsync Foundation acts as program admin, posts semiannual updates, can pause or cancel distributions, and will return any unused tokens. The Token Assembly retains the right to shut the program down via TPP. A simple form for community suggestions on additional events will be added at on-chain submission.


### **[ZIP-13] Adding a ZKsync OS CTM**

StanislavBreadless [posted a draft ZIP-13](https://forum.zknation.io/t/zip-13-adding-a-zksync-os-ctm/776) to add a new ZKsync OS–based ChainTypeManager (CTM) in Bridgehub so ZKsync OS chains can launch on mainnet with full EVM equivalence and cheaper, faster proofs via the Airbender RISC-V prover. Matter Labs would deploy the CTM; governance would do a one-time registration, and a temporary dev multisig would control it early on for fast patches, with ownership moving to decentralized governance once mature. There are no breaking changes for existing chains; OS chains will be isolated (can’t connect to ZKsync Gateway at first), and v29 security guardrails apply: CTM-matching is required for Gateway connection, and the chainBalance accounting prevents withdrawing more than deposited.

## **Scroll**


### **Scroll — Governance Slowdown**

Scroll leadership (Sandy, Raza, Haichen) [announced](https://forum.scroll.io/t/weekly-governance-recap-sept-8-12/1149) a pause on new proposals and voting while a new governance model is designed. Approved proposals already in flight will continue to move forward. Governance remains in place to oversee execution during the redesign, with a focus on alignment, efficiency, and sustainability. Additionally, Eugene has [communicated](https://t.me/c/2387174013/1562) via telegram his resignation as governance lead. 

As L2BEAT, we look forward to seeing the updated plan of this new governance model that will be implemented.
