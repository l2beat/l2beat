## **Optimism**


### **Governance Fund Mission Request: Cross-Chain Key Management for Safe**

Blockdev [created a post](https://gov.optimism.io/t/governance-fund-mission-request-cross-chain-key-management-for-safe/10294) that outlines a Season 8 mission to build a Safe module for unified signer updates across OP Stack chains. The request funds up to two teams (21,000 OP each; 42,000 OP total) to develop a hub-and-spoke module with cross-chain messaging, open-source contracts/docs, a prototype on three or more testnets, propagation to five chains within approximately five minutes, and an external audit. Sponsor is Pierce; the DAB Foundation Mission Team reviews. The deadline to apply is October 10, with selection by October 17, and the start date is October 20.


### **Governance Fund Mission Request: Open-source Monitoring & alerting**

Blockdev [created a post](https://gov.optimism.io/t/governance-fund-mission-request-open-source-monitoring-alerting/10293) that outlines a Season 8 mission to build an open-source monitoring and alerting SDK for OP Stack chains, including a dashboard, Slack/Telegram/PagerDuty alerts, custom invariant checks (single or multi-address), and optional auto-actions (e.g., pausing). The scope ships an extensible ruleset framework with reference rules for Uniswap v3 and Aave v3, permissive OSS licensing, docs, and a complete UI; milestones progress from basic ERC-20 alerting to validated rulesets and a full SDK. The request totals 114,000 OP (52,000 OP per team, with a maximum of two teams), sponsored by Pierce and reviewed by the DAB Foundation Mission Team. Submissions are due on October 10, selection will take place by October 17, and work will commence on October 20.


### **Token House participation and incentives: Season 7 (Cycle 31a-38)**

SEEDGov [created a post](https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-participation-and-incentives-season-7-cycle-31a-38/10297/2) that outlines final takeaways from Season 7: budgets diversified away from a Grants-Council heavy model toward specialized bodies (M&M, Security Council, DAB); transparency improved with the first published Security Council budget and standardized reporting (e.g., OSO’s impact analyses and Season 8 budget reports); qualitative engagement slipped despite steady voting, with fewer rationales and forum comments, suggesting a need for more organic delegate discussion as optimistic approvals simplify governance; and mid-tier delegates (250k–1.5M VP) emerged as the most consistent stabilizers of participation, while the smallest cohort was erratic and the largest often voted reliably but shared fewer rationales.

[Transfer 8,500 ETH from the Treasury to ATMC’s ETH Treasury Strategies](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x15d7bef4adb076e13fbbc0941543eb93cff9512e2c83ada0498ef1df290c67a5) - ends on October 2 at 19:00 UTC.

### **Integration of Hexens’ Glider Platform into the Arbitrum Ecosystem**

HaykK [created a proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/draft-non-constitutional-integration-of-hexens-glider-platform-into-the-arbitrum-ecosystem/30013) outlining the integration of Hexens’ Glider security engine into Arbitrum, with a request for 1.5M ARB over 12 months, milestone-gated. The plan is fully off-chain and adds chain-wide contract labeling and Arbiscan integration, automated user risk warnings, a public API and screener, “1-day protection” opt-in monitoring for protocols, and Glider IDE access, along with ongoing SOC-style scanning and monthly reports for the Security Council. The post argues that Glider could have flagged 90%+ of past exploit patterns on Arbitrum, aiming to improve transparency and reduce hack risk without requiring protocol changes that materially impact the protocol.

### **Grow Uniswap on Plasma**

Abdullah Umar [created a post](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/grow-uniswap-on-plasma/25835) outlining the UAC and Uniswap Growth Program’s plan, working with Plasma, to allocate $250k in UNI from the UAC’s discretionary budget (pending legal clearance) and to seek an additional $250k via the whole governance process to boost Uniswap v3 on Plasma. Plasma is committing up to $5M over six months, with a $500k-per-month floor already in place; once the UAC can disburse, Uniswap’s $250k will “catch up” over the remaining months. Incentives will target XPL/USD₮0, ETH/USD₮0, weETH/USD₮0, XAUT/USD₮0 pairs (with Uniswap placing extra emphasis on ETH and stables), aiming to capture stablecoin-driven order flow on a chain positioned for zero-fee USDT transfers and rapid DeFi growth.

## **Everclear**


### **ESC Elections 2025 - RFC**

SEEDGov [created a post outlining](https://forum.connext.network/t/esc-elections-2025-rfc/1396) the framework for this year’s Security Council elections: nine seats are up for election (eight members plus a Council Lead), with rotation of the 7/9 multisig signers. Candidates must pass KYC/KYB, disclose COIs, have a relevant technical background, and be available for emergencies; the Lead must also demonstrate deep audit/upgrade expertise and propose a scope and budget. Elections (weighted + shielded voting with responsible self-voting rules) run as two votes: one for members and one for the Lead. Timeline: Applications, Sept 29–Oct 13; Compliance, Oct 13–20; Candidate Intro Call, Oct 16 at 10:00 ET; Voting, Oct 20–29. Compensation remains approximately $1,500/mo (in CLEAR) for members; the Lead’s budget will be set via their proposal, with three executable votes required to finalize.


### **RFC — V4 Protocol Upgrade Reward Proposal**

Max Kalyuzhnyi [created a post](https://forum.connext.network/t/rfc-v4-protocol-upgrade-reward-proposal/1398) that outlines the V4 upgrade for Everclear, pairing its hub-and-spoke clearing layer with Proxima’s open-source solver framework to boost clearing volume and cut costs. The upgrade introduces a modular gateway for multiple messaging providers, cross-chain asset settlement (rebalancing across assets/representations within Everclear), and a fast-path option targeting sub-60-second settlement, opening new fee lanes beyond ~0.3 basis points today. A private mainnet is targeted for Nov–Dec 2025, with the public mainnet in Q1 2026. The post also requests 60M CLEAR to replenish the Foundation treasury (50% unlocked, 50% vesting over 12 months) to fund V4 delivery, integrations, audits, and ecosystem growth, with bi-annual transparency reports.

## **Scroll**


### **Governance Council Selection Thread (GC)**

Juansito [created a post](https://forum.scroll.io/t/governance-council-selection-thread-gc/1214/1) that opens applications for the new Governance Council, outlining two external seats (split seats allowed) for a 3-month initial term at ~30k SCR per seat. The Council’s mandate is to draft an updated governance design and constitutional changes aligned with Scroll’s revised model, which includes Foundation oversight with operational autonomy, annual/biannual treasury setting, and day-to-day operations led by councils/delegates (with Foundation veto when necessary). Responsibilities include collaborating with Foundation/Labs/delegates, leading the governance redesign, and ensuring long-term alignment. Candidates with DAO design/ops, community leadership, legal/org/budget expertise, and alignment-building experience are invited to apply via the [Tally form](https://tally.so/r/wbPNML).


### **Proposal: Evolving Scroll’s Focus Areas Into a Structured Long-Term Strategy**

Unite [has created](https://forum.scroll.io/t/proposal-evolving-scroll-s-focus-areas-into-a-structured-long-term-strategy/1251) a post that proposes turning the Ecosystem Growth Council’s four focus areas into a 3–5 year strategic plan with annual allocation ranges and reviews. The aim is to make priorities operational—setting time horizons and indicative weightings across Builder/Founder support, Liquidity & Infrastructure, Community growth, and User retention—so councils execute against a stable, long-term roadmap rather than reinterpreting goals each term. The suggested model includes annual adjustments based on performance, while maintaining the overall direction, and invites collaboration to formalize a community signaling draft.
