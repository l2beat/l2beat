### **AVI Final Report**

ArbitrumVentures [has posted](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/avi-final-report/28846/1) a wrap-up of the Arbitrum Ventures Initiative (AVI) pilot, which started in August 2024 to address DAO venture proposals and lay out a long-term ecosystem investment framework. During its pilot phase, AVI developed strategic recommendations for phased implementation (pilot, build, and full deployment), tested approaches for a direct investment fund, and engaged delegates through workshops, reporting calls, and market consultation. The team also explored a “Plaid for Crypto” thesis, focusing on on-chain institutional-grade liquidity and the potential influence of AI-driven capital.

Looking ahead, AVI intends to pause for about 3 months to align with emerging DAO developments – such as Tandem, OpCo, the Arbitrum Foundation, and additional treasury initiatives – before advancing into the next proposed phase. Once this period concludes, a refined plan (covering fund structures, oversight committees, thematic funds, and potential “Captive Liquid Fund” concepts) will be put forth to ensure strong alignment with Arbitrum’s priorities and a sustainable, DAO-driven investing model.


### **The Arbitrum Foundation 2024 Transparency Report: A Year of Key Milestones and Progress**

Arbitrum [has shared](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/the-arbitrum-foundation-2024-transparency-report-a-year-of-key-milestones-and-progress/28832/1) its Annual Transparency Report, highlighting the DAO’s achievements in ecosystem grants, developer education, technical upgrades, and broader community building throughout 2024. Significant milestones include approving 276 projects in diverse verticals (DeFi, gaming, NFTs), bolstering partnerships with a 250M ARB allocation for strategic initiatives, and expanding the Ambassador Program to 18 countries. Technical advances, such as Stylus and BoLD, marked notable steps toward a more flexible and secure rollup architecture. The Foundation also operationalized various DAO-approved proposals, including Real-World Asset investments via the STEP program, ensuring transparency and community-driven decision-making as Arbitrum prepares to enter 2025.


### **AVI Strategic Recommendations: Building an Evergreen Investment Strategy for Arbitrum**

ArbitrumVentures[ has published](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/avi-strategic-recommendations-building-an-evergreen-investment-strategy-for-arbitrum/28845/1) strategic guidelines to shape the full-scale launch of Arbitrum Ventures (AV)—building on their pilot-phase research and community feedback. The recommended approach centers on an evergreen fund-of-funds, balancing short-term DeFi investments (Arbitrum’s strongest vertical) with early bets on emerging market narratives. This model combines captive (directly DAO-managed) and non-captive (externally managed) vehicles, offering flexibility in how capital is deployed.

Under this 3-phase plan, Phase 2 would formalize core structures (e.g., an Interim Expert Council, an Investment Committee, and a “Fund-in-a-Box” framework) while making targeted investments. Once fully operational in Phase 3, AV aims to scale multiple programs—such as a Strategic Direct Fund, Scouts Program, and a Captive Liquid Fund—reinvesting proceeds perpetually. The proposal also emphasizes stablecoin-based deployments (predominantly USDC) for simplicity and reduced volatility, alongside “Performance Warrants” to align incentives between ecosystem builders, fund managers, and the DAO.


### **Arbitrum Security Council Recommendations**

OpenZeppelin [has shared](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-security-council-recommendations/28850/1) a report evaluating potential improvements to the Security Council, which defends over $14B in assets on Arbitrum. The authors propose clarifying “governance attacks” in the constitution, limiting pseudonymous membership to three, and adding a basic technical competency demonstration during the compliance phase. They also advise allowing organizations to hold council seats through 1-of-N multi-signature wallets (N≤3), preserving emergency action powers (rather than veto-only), and maintaining the current 12-month staggered terms.

The report underscores the need for impartial, technically proficient council members who can independently assess threats, verify transactions on-chain, and respond quickly to incidents. While more decentralized setups remain a long-term goal, OpenZeppelin’s recommendations prioritize strong defense and operational continuity during this early stage of Arbitrum’s evolution.

### **Introducing SafeNotes: transparent tracking of DAO spending**

alicecorsini [has announced](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/introducing-safenotes-transparent-tracking-of-dao-spending/25421?u=manugotsuka) the launch of SafeNotes, a tool that enables DAOs to annotate and categorize multisig transactions with clear, public descriptions. Initially developed for the ENS DAO, SafeNotes is now adopted by the Uniswap DAO’s UAC (Uniswap Accountability Committee) to provide a transparent record of payments and incentives. By categorizing each transaction and explaining its purpose, SafeNotes aims to give real-time visibility into DAO operations and serve as a model for broader adoption.

### **Heimdall security fix for tendermint disseminating invalid block parts**

Parvez03 from the Polygon Validators Support Team [has announced](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/heimdall-security-fix-for-tendermint-disseminating-invalid-block-parts/20819) a critical fix addressing an inherited Tendermint vulnerability in Heimdall. In older versions, a malicious peer could attach a valid Merkle proof to the wrong part of a proposed block, causing nodes to accept fraudulent data and stall block propagation if enough validators were affected. With Heimdall v1.2.1, a patch in the Tendermint fork (Peppermint v0.33.4) now ensures Part.Index equals Proof.Index, preventing malicious block-part mismatches. Validator operators have been asked to upgrade to Heimdall v1.2.1 or newer as soon as possible to maintain network stability and avoid invalid block propagation.

## **ZkSync**


### **[ZIP-9] V27 EVM Emulation Upgrade**

VladislavVolosnikov (Matter Labs) [has introduced ZIP-9](https://forum.zknation.io/t/zip-9-v27-evm-emulation-upgrade/626), which targets the V27 upgrade of ZKsync with two main components: EVM emulation (allowing developers to deploy EVM contracts without recompilation) and a Fflonk verifier for more efficient proof verification on Ethereum. By running the EVM as an emulation layer atop EraVM, ZKsync aims to streamline integration with standard Solidity, Vyper, and popular tooling, although emulated contracts may have higher costs and won’t be fully identical to native EVM execution. The Fflonk verifier, deployed alongside the existing Plonk verifier, is expected to cut on-chain verification costs by approximately 30%. These additions, along with minor circuit and bootloader changes, were audited for security and tested against core Ethereum state tests, moving ZKsync closer to bytecode-level EVM equivalence envisioned in the 2025 roadmap.

## **Scroll**


### **Proposal: Euclid Upgrade**

Roylou [has introduced](https://forum.scroll.io/t/proposal-euclid-upgrade/565?u=manugotsuka) the Euclid Upgrade for Scroll, aiming to deliver significant protocol enhancements via two-phased deployments in April 2025. This is the largest upgrade since the mainnet launch and incorporates five core changes:



* Migration to OpenVM Prover.
* MPT State Commitment.
* Optimized Rollup Process.
* EIP-7702 & RIP-7212 support.
* Stage-1 Readiness.


### The estimated impact of this implementation will be:



* Users: Expect ~80% cost reductions, 4× throughput gains, and short service interruptions during each deployment phase.
* Node Operators: Must switch to MPT-based nodes (with a full resync) and watch for new permissionless batch submission processes.
* Indexers & Dapps: Should adapt to revised batch encodings (multiple batches per transaction), updated message queues, and new function signatures.

With these changes, Scroll aims to improve performance, security, and long-term decentralization, marking a key milestone in its roadmap. Detailed audits, code references, and rollout updates are available in the linked repositories, and the Scroll team will release further guidance as the upgrade nears.


### **Proposal: Scroll DAO Delegate Accelerator Proposal**

Kene_StableLab and Nneoma_StableLab [created a post](https://forum.scroll.io/t/proposal-scroll-dao-delegate-accelerator-proposal/571) that outlines a Delegate Accelerator (D/Acc) program for the Scroll DAO, requesting $90,000 plus 100,000 SCR in delegated voting power. This seven-week pilot aims to expand and professionalize the DAO’s delegate base, mitigate governance risks, and improve proposal quality. Through modules covering DAO governance fundamentals, strategic proposal analysis, conflict resolution, and Scroll-specific insights, up to 20 trainees will engage in live sessions, assessments, and gamified tasks, earning performance-based incentives and 5,000 SCR delegations if they complete the program. 

The curriculum is designed and delivered by a team of contributors from StableLab, SEEDGov, Factory Labs, and others. At the same time, Factory Labs’ VOICE tool will facilitate in-program feedback and a post-delivery survey. A detailed breakdown allocates $15,000 for trainee rewards, $60,000 for curriculum and facilitation, and $15,000 for a budget buffer, with unspent funds either returned or rolled into subsequent programs. The proposal envisions higher voter turnout, improved proposal rigor, and broader community resilience, concluding with a post-program report measuring delegate retention, proposal outcomes, and community sentiment.
