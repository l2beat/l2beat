### **Security Council Season 7 Retroactive Funding Request**

The OPSC has [created a proposal](https://gov.optimism.io/t/security-council-season-7-retroactive-funding-request/10134) that seeks 346,920 OP in retroactive compensation for Season 7 (Jan–Jun 2025), citing a materially higher workload: the council now signs for five OP Stack chains and completed 19 upgrade ceremonies in six months (vs. six in all of 2024). Funds would be distributed unlocked and equally to 14 members (13 signers + lead) at 24,780 OP each. At the Foundation’s request, the ask was moved from 88 ETH to OP from the Governance Fund, using a Q2 average price reference of $0.67.

### **Grant and Project Progress Tracking Platform for Optimism**

BuildUnion [proposes](https://gov.optimism.io/t/grant-and-project-progress-tracking-platform-for-optimism/10170) a one-time $5k build for a public dashboard that unifies oversight of all OP‑funded work—grants, Retro Funding recipients, partner teams, and ecosystem initiatives—into one place. The tool would display milestone progress with real-time updates, configurable alerts, and lightweight ML-based risk flags, along with an independent automated oversight layer that identifies anomalies without requiring manual reporting. Admin features for the Grants Council/RPGF reviewers include role-based access and intervention tools, with 12 months of maintenance and easy integration into the Optimism forum or contributor portal.

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

You can find us to discuss everything related to Optimism’s governance, from current initiatives to high-level conversations, during our [Optimism Office Hours](https://meet.google.com/pem-jzrh-gkq) every Tuesday at 3 pm UTC.

### **Delegate Incentive Program Results (June 2025)**

SEEDGov [has submitted](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/dip-v1-6-delegate-incentive-program-results-june-2025/29657/1) the results of the DIP for June, reporting 79 enrolled and 66 qualifying delegates. Scores reflected participation in 7 Snapshot votes, 1 on‑chain (Tally) vote, and engagement across 6 forum discussions used for the “presence in discussion” multiplier. Twenty delegates qualified for compensation totaling $72,234.34, distributed as Tier 1: 1, Tier 2: 4, Tier 3: 15. Bonus Points were awarded for exceptional contributions (L2BEAT 15, Tekr0x 20, LamprosDAO 20, TempeTechie 15).


### **ARDC V2 Final Update & Concluding Report**

ARDC V2 wrapped on July 12 after the DAO opted not to extend its six‑month term. The team’s [last deliverable](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-v2-final-update-concluding-report/29652)—a full Ecosystem Mapping & Positioning study by DeFiLlama Research and Castle Capital—joins eight research outputs covering grants and incentives, governance‑attack resilience, sequencer‑revenue sustainability, vote‑buying services, technical decision‑making, and Security Council improvements (with OpenZeppelin crediting 48 audit hours back to the Foundation’s subsidy program). In total, $294,880 was paid to service providers (DeFiLlama: $94,200; Castle Capital: $78,750; Nethermind: $55,930; OpenZeppelin: $66,000), with $266,080 allocated to fund published research.

## **Uniswap**


### **[RFC] Governance Logistics Improvements**

The Uniswap Accountability Committee (UAC) [initiates a discussion](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-governance-logistics-improvements/25737) on governance mechanics, noting Uniswap’s unusually high quorum (~$280M, approximately 6.66% of the circulating supply) compared to peer DAOs, and weighing its security benefits against the trade-offs of participation and concentration. While not recommending a quorum change at this time, the post explores “optimistic governance” through Aragon OSx’s staged proposal processor, which delegates routine, pre-scope actions to committees with a community veto window, and examines veto-threshold design to prevent abuse.

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

You can find us to discuss everything related to Uniswap’s governance, from current initiatives to high-level conversations, during our [L2BEAT Governance Office Hours](https://meet.google.com/twm-jafw-esn) every Friday at 3 pm UTC.

## **Polygon**


### **PFP-4: CTB Season 3 Funding Strategy**

Polygon’s Community Treasury Board [published](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pfp-4-ctb-season-3-funding-strategy/21151) its Season 3 plan, capping spend at 80M POL through end‑2025 and pivoting from grants‑only to a broader investment model. The CTB will run Funds and Programs with vetted Program Directors (initially from Polygon Labs) to execute deals. At the same time, the CTB retains complete wallet control and can pause or reallocate if mandatory public reporting and ROI targets aren’t met. Seasons move to contiguous, six‑month cycles (S3 ≈5 months; S4 starts Jan 1, 2026), and the CTB will still consider ad‑hoc forum requests alongside the new, more decentralized and accountable framework.


### **Grant Progress Tracking Platform for Polygon**

BuildUnion [proposes](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/grant-progress-tracking-platform-for-polygon/21156) a public dashboard to centralize oversight of Polygon‑funded grants for $3,999 (build + 12 months of maintenance). The MVP would track milestones in real-time, surface ML-based risk flags, send delay/deviation alerts, and offer role-based admin tools and filterable portfolio views, with links to forum/GitHub threads for transparency and faster intervention on stalled work.


### **PIP-69: Full ERC-20 Functionality for Validator Share Tokens**

Pete Kim [created a draft](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-69-full-erc-20-functionality-for-validator-share-tokens/21162/1) to upgrade to Polygon’s ValidatorShare contracts, making per‑validator “dPOL[ID]” share tokens fully ERC‑20 (approve/transferFrom restored, ERC‑2612 permit, proper metadata) while preserving auto‑reward claims on transfer. The goal is to make POL liquid-staking tokens trivial to build and unlock liquidity for staked POL via a proxy upgrade, with unchanged storage and standard ERC-20 allowance risks noted.

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

You can find us to discuss everything related to Polygon’s governance, from current initiatives to high-level conversations, during our [L2BEAT Governance Office Hours](https://meet.google.com/twm-jafw-esn) every Friday at 3 pm UTC.


## **Starknet**


### **Grant Progress Tracking Platform for Starknet**

BuildUnion [proposes](https://community.starknet.io/t/grant-progress-tracking-platform-for-starknet/115797) a one-time build of $3,999 for a public dashboard that centralizes oversight of Starknet-funded grants. The tool would track milestones with real-time updates, send automated delay/deviation alerts, and surface ML-based risk signals, with admin controls for grant stewards and role-based access for contributors and the public. The MVP includes 12 months of maintenance and can be embedded directly into the Starknet forum for easy access.


### **SNIP 33 - proposal for Starknet decentralized validation**

Ohad Barta [created a proposal](https://community.starknet.io/t/snip-33-proposal-for-starknet-decentralized-validation/115811) that outlines the next decentralization milestone for Starknet v0.15: decentralized validation. A top-100, stake-weighted committee would attest blocks (requiring more than two-thirds), and each block would also require a preannounced “rewarded proposer” signature for rewards and liveness. Targets include a ≤5% throughput impact compared to v0.14, validator cost of ≤$ 1,000/month, sub-second preconfirmations, and no breaking changes. A guarded “centralization lever” would temporarily bypass validation if production stalls, with time limits and oversight by the Security Council.

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

You can find us to discuss everything related to Starknet’s governance, from current initiatives to high-level conversations, during our [L2BEAT Governance Office Hours](https://meet.google.com/twm-jafw-esn) every Friday at 3 pm UTC.


## **Everclear**


### **Executable [CGP#] — EverScale Close-Out & Token Return**

Max_kalyuzhnyi [created a proposal](https://forum.connext.network/t/executable-cgp-everscale-close-out-token-return/1388) to end the EverScale Grant Program after its first four‑month season and send roughly 33.33M CLEAR from the Grants BORG back to the DAO treasury, keeping 14.94M CLEAR reserved to honor already‑signed deals. With only 1.72M CLEAR distributed and organic solver/MM growth now meeting targets, the program would sunset with no new applications post‑vote, lifting the treasury to about 139.5M CLEAR (+31%).

## **Lisk**


## **Active Votes**

[Lisk DAO Season 2](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/lisk/proposal/32814469402399452716516255556117334038308646649824971467378299056369841520770) - ends on August 4 at 11:48 UTC.


### **The Lisk Partner Delegation Program**

The Lisk team (via the Onchain Foundation) [created a proposal](https://forum.lisk.com/t/the-lisk-partner-delegation-program/493) that will delegate 3M vpLSK to selected partner delegates—300k per team, 150k per individual—to boost DAO decentralization, bring seasoned ecosystem contributors into governance, and align long‑term partners. The program begins with DAO Season 2, with participation reviewed each season and a broader review after ~12 months; longer‑term, delegates may move to a “voting‑power boost” model that matches self‑delegation.


### **Financial support from the Onchain Foundation for Lisk**

In response to questions raised during the 100M LSK vote, the Lisk team [clarifies](https://forum.lisk.com/t/financial-support-from-the-onchain-foundation-for-lisk/494) that the Onchain Foundation (a separate entity from Lisk Ltd.) continues to fund Lisk’s operations and team. At the same time, DAO‑minted tokens are intended to drive ecosystem growth. Beyond ongoing foundation support, all LSK and OP held by the Foundation or Lisk Ltd. (excluding ~7.9M legacy ICO LSK) are earmarked for Lisk, including 30M LSK reserved for strategic investors at the time of migration.

## **Scroll**


### **Better DAO Decisions & Aligned Incentives: Research on Carroll Mechanisms**

Connormcmk has created a post that [outlines](https://forum.scroll.io/t/better-dao-decisions-aligned-incentives-research-on-carroll-mechanisms/992) a 6-month R&D push (Aug 2025–Jul 2026) to test and implement “Carroll Mechanisms,” an evolution of futarchy/prediction markets aimed at aligning incentives, improving deliberation, and fairly rewarding Scroll delegates. Led by Dr. Philip Brown with RnDAO, the plan funds feasibility research, parameterization, and integration into the Negation Game, structured as a $ 145,000 SAFE+ token warrant at a $12 million cap (not a grant). If Milestone 1 proves viable, later phases will deliver a production integration for Scroll governance.
