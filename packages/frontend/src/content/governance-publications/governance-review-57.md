### **Evolution of Retro Funding in Season 8**

[Season 7‚Äôs](https://gov.optimism.io/t/evolution-of-retro-funding-in-season-8/10024) monthly, algorithm-driven Retro Funding was a success: builders loved the steady payouts and data-backed scoring. But letting Citizens vote on the scoring math flopped‚Äîmost couldn‚Äôt decode the formulas, and it injected volatility. For Season 8, algorithms will remain open-source but will be tuned by the Open Source Observer (no longer requiring votes), while citizens retain budget veto power. Expect the same predictable monthly rewards, clearer impact dashboards on OP Atlas, and even smarter metrics thanks to upgraded EIP-4337 and dependency-graph tracking. Dive into the post to see how these tweaks aim to boost trust and keep Retro Funding fast, fair, and builder-friendly.


### **Upgrade 16 Proposal: Interop Contracts, Stage 1, and Go 1.23 Support in Cannon**

Kelvin has published  ‚Äú[Upgrade 16](https://gov.optimism.io/t/upgrade-16-proposal-interop-contracts-stage-1-and-go-1-23-support-in-cannon/10037)‚Äù, a protocol upgrade proposal that quietly prepares every OP Stack chain for the upcoming Superchain interoperability. The patch swaps in new bridge contracts, removes the extra ‚ÄúDeputy Guardian‚Äù role so only the Security Council can pause withdrawals, and lifts the per-block gas ceiling from 200 m to 500 m. Cannon now supports Go 1.23 and a second proof system called Kona, broadening fault-proof diversity. Existing withdrawal proofs will need to be re-proved, but the team expects no downtime. Audit contests revealed only low-severity issues, all of which were fixed. If delegates approve, mainnet chains will upgrade on 24 July, setting the stage for the full interop ‚Äúon‚Äù switch in Upgrade 17. Read Kelvin‚Äôs full post for the spec, runbook links, and the exact multisig payloads.

### **AIP: Update the Upgrade Executors**

The Arbitrum Foundation [has submitted](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/constitutional-aip-update-the-upgrade-executors/29463/2) a constitutional AIP to swap in upgraded ‚ÄúUpgrade Executor‚Äù contracts across Arbitrum One, Nova, and the L1 bridge. The new executors introduce a handy executeCall() function, allowing future governance actions to interact directly with target contracts, thereby eliminating the need for extra delegate-call wrappers and one-off action contracts. Nothing else about upgrade powers changes‚Äîthe DAO still owns the keys‚Äîbut day-to-day upgrades should get faster and cheaper for devs. No new funding is requested, and the code has been tested and audited since January 2023.


### **Audit Committee Technical Expert Elections**

The Arbitrum Foundation [has opened](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/audit-committee-technical-expert-elections/29474) elections for the single ‚ÄúTechnical Expert‚Äù seat on the new Audit Committee and is asking the DAO to decide between two finalists. The role pays $5k a month for roughly one to two days of work each week and covers tasks like checking third-party audit reports and matching projects with the right security firm.

From a pool of 68 applicants, the Foundation has shortlisted Gustavo Grieco and Andrei Andonov. Both will introduce themselves on a community call on 24 June 14:00 UTC; a Snapshot vote opens on 26 June. Shielded voting rules apply, and the winner will start in early July to help spin up the Arbitrum Audit Program.


### **Entropy Advisors: Exclusively Working with the Arbitrum DAO, Y2-Y3**

Entropy Advisors [created a proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/entropy-advisors-exclusively-working-with-the-arbitrum-dao-y2-y3/29458/1) for a two-year renewal and an expanded mandate from the DAO. Founders Matt Fiebach and Sam Martin say their seven-person team spent Year 1 drafting key proposals (STEP II, DRIP, ARB staking group, and events budget), running ‚ÄúDelegate Days,‚Äù and building widely used Arbitrum data dashboards. Now they want to focus full-time on treasury strategy, incentive design, analytics, and BD support that turns Arbitrum into ‚Äúthe most effective capital-allocating DAO.‚Äù

The ask: $6 million in ARB over 24 months for salaries, plus 15 million ARB that vests over three years to keep the team‚Äôs incentives locked to Arbitrum‚Äôs success. Entropy pledges monthly public reports and gives the DAO a simple Snapshot path to end the deal if targets aren‚Äôt met. Full details, a candid Year-1 retrospective, and the planned Year-2/3 workstreams are in the forum post‚Äîworth a read before the discussion window closes.


### **Arbitrum Research and Development Collective V2 - Extension**

Immutablelawyer [has created](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-research-and-development-collective-v2-extension/29476) a proposal that requests a six-month renewal for the Arbitrum Audit R&D Collective (ARDC), activating the second half of the ARDC V2 budget, allowing the research (DeFi Llama + Castle), risk (Nethermind), and security (OpenZeppelin) teams to continue their work through January 2026. The DAO can (A) extend as-is, (B) extend but re-elect working members, or (C) end the program and return the unused funds. The snapshot vote will decide.

## **Uniswap**


### **[RFC] Etherlink x Uniswap - Co-incentive Proposal**

Dtz_NL [has filed an RFC](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-etherlink-x-uniswap-co-incentive-proposal/25670) proposing a joint incentive program for Uniswap v3 on Etherlink, the Tezos-secured L2 that has seen its TVL increase from $1.5M to $40M this year. The Tezos Foundation will commit $300k in rewards and seed liquidity to WETH/USDC, WBTC/USDC, and LBTC/USDC pools during Apple Farm Season 2 (mid-July ‚Üí mid-October). They‚Äôre asking the Uniswap DAO to contribute another $150k so Uniswap becomes the go-to venue for every new, uncorrelated token launching on Etherlink.

## **Starknet**


### **Introducing SN 0.13.6**

Ohad-StarkWare [dropped](https://community.starknet.io/t/introducing-sn-0-13-6/115678) the SN 0.13.6, paving the way for the new ‚ÄúS-Two‚Äù prover.

The config-only patch lets Starknet switch from the current Stone prover to S-Two, a Circle-STARK system that cuts block proof time from ~24 min to &lt; 3 min and halves costs. Because S-Two‚Äôs field makes certain built-ins heavier, the release activates per-builtin resource caps and temporarily disables Cairo Native to prevent unprovable blocks. Fees remain the same, and Cairo Native will be updated once the extra counting logic is implemented (target: Q3). Faster, cheaper proofs and three-minute ‚Äúpush-to-L1‚Äù finality are now in sight.

## **Everclear**


### **Everclear DAO Financial Report 2025**

SEEDGov [posted](https://forum.connext.network/t/everclear-dao-financial-report-2025/1382) Everclear‚Äôs Jan-May 2025 treasury summary. The update shows $3.23M in assets (‚âà81 % CLEAR, 9 % NEXT, 9 % ETH) and details a hefty 75.4M CLEAR in grant outflows, offset by 6M CLEAR in claw-backs and buybacks. Net result: the main multisig‚Äôs balance slid from 175.6M to 106.1M CLEAR over five months, while smaller vaults still hold another 11M CLEAR plus assorted ETH and USDC. Revenue tracking is coming in the following report.

## **ZkSync**


### **ZKnomics Roadmap Vision**

Omar [posted](https://forum.zknation.io/t/zknomics-roadmap-vision/712) ‚ÄúZK nomics,‚Äù a new roadmap for ZKsync‚Äôs token. The post outlines a four-step plan‚Äîpermissionless staking, a burn-enabled token upgrade, fee switches for sequencer and interop, and on-chain allocation rules‚Äîthat would route protocol fees into burns and staking rewards. Each stage comes as a separate ZIP voting and ties to infrastructure already rolling out (Gateway, EVM-equivalence, Prividium, solx). Read the vision to see how usage fees could start shrinking supply and paying stakers as soon as the tooling lands.

## **Scroll**


### **P2P Compensation System for Gov Retribution Compensation working group**

Goodstuff [pitches](https://forum.scroll.io/t/p2p-compensation-system-for-gov-retribution-compensation-working-group/876) ‚ÄúCollabBerry,‚Äù a peer-to-peer pay tool for Scroll‚Äôs new Gov Compensation WG. The post argues that DAO pay is still murky and proposes an on-chain, AI-assisted system where teammates rate each other each pay cycle; a transparent algorithm then splits funds and mints soul-bound proof-of-work tokens. CollabBerry is live on Arbitrum, and the author asks Scroll builders whether deploying it next could resolve unclear, token-only payouts and provide early contributors with fair retroactive rewards.


### **Proposal: Security Subsidy Program for Scroll Builders**

Samater [has submitted](https://forum.scroll.io/t/proposal-security-subsidy-program-for-scroll-builders/872) a $500k ‚ÄúSecurity Subsidy Program‚Äù pilot that aims to make professional audits and post-launch protection affordable for projects graduating from Scroll Open. Under the plan, the DAO would earmark $300k to cover up to 90 % of each team‚Äôs audit bill on Areta‚Äôs marketplace, plus $200k for Immunefi‚Äôs Magnus platform, which bundles discounted bug-bounty hosting, fuzzing, formal verification, PR reviews, and real-time monitoring. Eligibility will be determined by a rating sheet and investment-style agreements to discourage subsidy farming; any unused funds will be returned to the treasury.


### **Proposal: Nigeria Local Node**

Abidemi Adenle, Web3Bridge‚Äôs Ayodeji Awosika, and Web3Afrika‚Äôs Idris Olubisi have [submitted](https://forum.scroll.io/t/proposal-nigeria-local-node/864) a $30k, 12-week plan to test Scroll‚Äôs ‚ÄúLocal Node‚Äù model in Nigeria. In weeks 1-2, the team will catalogue 50-plus crypto start-ups, interview founders, and score the clearest zk-EVM use-cases (think cheap remittances, privacy rails, and DePIN). A six-week virtual builders‚Äô programme, run by Web3Bridge, will follow, pairing technical training with business-model mentoring and culminating in a demo day focused on Scroll Open. Parallel events‚Äîa founders‚Äô round-table, an open Community Day run by Web3Afrika, and a post-programme feedback dinner‚Äîwill gauge market fit, surface blockers, and cultivate local champions. Success targets: three high-energy events, at least ten graduates actively deploying to the Scroll testnet/mainnet, and five teams ready for Scroll Open. Findings, contact lists, and a ‚Äúscale/pause‚Äù recommendation are presented to the DAO in week 12.
