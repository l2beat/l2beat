### **4337 Superchain Data Standards: Project Update**

Kamil Gorski [posted](https://gov.optimism.io/t/4337-superchain-data-standards-group-project-update/10192) an update on the 4337 Data & Standards group. The team shipped a public 4337 data model and an ETL that streams decoded activity from 23 Superchain networks into BigQuery with daily freshness. A shared metrics and attribution set—already used in Retro Funding—sits on top. Labels are anchored on-chain via the Open Label Initiative, covering 90%+ of known operators, with docs and tutorials for anyone to query and extend.

### **Disclosure of support for EIP-2537 on Arbitrum One and Nova**

Offchain Labs [posted](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/disclosure-of-support-for-eip-2537-on-arbitrum-one-and-nova/29720) a technical update: the BLS12-381 precompiles in EIP-2537 were added in ArbOS 40 but weren’t actually enabled, so Arbitrum chains don’t support them yet. Enabling will require a new ArbOS release, a mandatory node upgrade, and a Constitutional proposal to the DAO. OCL plans to ship EIP-2537 with the next major ArbOS release (ArbOS 50), alongside other Ethereum-upgrade EIPs. They’re inviting feedback on prioritization in the forum and signal they’ll be more active in technical discussions going forward.


### **AGV Monthly Update (July 2025)**

ArbitrumGaming [posted](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/agv-monthly-update-july-2025/29731) a monthly update on AGV’s work. They published Transparency Report #, covering progress and lessons from the first half of the year, kicked off the “Next Level” series with a Wildcard playtest for delegates, and saw fresh press across Decrypt, Gam3s.GG, and, Pulse 2.0. The team also welcomed Ade Molajo as Grants Lead to sharpen grant design and tracking. Next up: finishing an internal framework to track investments and grants and announcing new hires, all aimed at keeping the DAO closely looped in on gaming growth.


### **July 2025 DRIP Update**

Entropy [posted](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/july-2025-drip-update/29690) an update on DRIP. Objective Labs is on for optimization and evaluation, and Merkl will handle distribution and the frontend. Season 1 is scheduled to end in late August while the team builds out the brand and GTM with a design agency (including a custom frontend wireframe that Merkl will implement). The first season targets ETH and stable looping with roughly $10M in ARB incentives, essentially asset-and market-agnostic, where protocols compete for performance-based rewards across supply and borrow. The north star is retained TVL after the incentive.

## **Polygon**


### **PIP-70: Increase Minstake to 100k POL**

Harry Rook [posted](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-70-increase-minstake-to-100k-pol/21176) a draft to raise Polygon PoS’s minimum self-stake for new validators to 100k POL by updating the StakeManager’s `minDeposit`—no redeploy required. It applies only to new entrants, aiming to improve incentive alignment and deter “slot sniping,” with no impact on current validators or delegators. The change is backward-compatible; the main trade-off is a higher capital cost if POL appreciates.

### **ZKsync Security Council v2 Funding**

ZKsync Security Council [posted](https://forum.zknation.io/t/tpp-draft-zksync-security-council-v2-funding/737/1) a draft to fund the restructured council for 12 months via a capped minter—up to 27.7M ZK ($1.108M) that scales down if the token price rises. The v2 model cuts cost by ~53% versus last year, sets a 12-member roster with 6–9 hour SLAs, and commits to publishing SOPs and bi-annual reports. The Token Assembly can cancel funding at any time, and any excess ZK is returned.

### **Request for Comments: DAO Treasury Management RFP**

Eugene [opened an RFC](https://forum.scroll.io/t/request-for-comments-dao-treasury-management-rfp/1000/1) to shape Scroll’s first treasury-management RFP. It asks the DAO to weigh in on selection mechanics (direct DAO vote, veto models), whether to hire one provider or a small group, risk limits and priorities (like stablecoin conversion and on-chain execution vs multisig), and whether a dedicated treasury council is desired. The aim is to set clear guardrails, then invite proposals from experienced teams; karpatkey, LlamaRisk, Avantgarde, and TokenLogic are among those already contacted. After the comment window, the governance team will post the RFP and shortlist candidates for public review.


### **Ecosystem Growth Council: Charter**

Sov [posted](https://forum.scroll.io/t/ecosystem-growth-council-charter/1027) the EGC charter, framing Scroll’s first council-based governance experiment. The five-seat body—three external, two from the Foundation—gets delegated authority and a 2M SCR budget to design, launch, and oversee ecosystem growth programs, with bi-weekly public updates. Decisions are one-seat-one-vote, simple majority with a four-seat quorum, and strict conflict-of-interest rules. Funding must be documented, diversified (no single program over 50% without unanimity), and can’t go to member-affiliated orgs without separate DAO approval. The council will ship at least one program and return with a renewal proposal.
