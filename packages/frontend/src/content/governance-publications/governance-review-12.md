## **Arbitrum**

### **On Chain Vote - Request for Continuation of the Arbitrum DDA Program Request**

[This proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/questbook-dda-program-phase-2-request-for-continuation/21326) seeks to start a new program for the Arbitrum Grants via DDA through Questbook with a budget of $4,000,000 spread across 4 domains over the next two quarters.

The [Tally vote](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/98446466630612736687159241204141593794174501692677162686607521796118942563659) ends on April 20 2024 at 5:57 pm UTC

### **[RFC] Activate Stylus and Enable Next-Gen WebAssembly Smart Contracts**

The Arbitrum Foundation [submitted an RFC](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-activate-stylus-and-enable-next-gen-webassembly-smart-contracts/22970) that outlines a path toward activating Stylus on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova. Stylus is an upgrade that introduces a new virtual machine that runs alongside the EVM which enables developers to write smart contracts in new programming languages, like Rust, that are more efficient than Solidity smart contracts.

### **[RFC] Request to match my donation to bootstrap Curve Lending on Arbitrum**

Michael Egorov, founder of Curve, [submitted an RFC](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-request-to-match-my-donation-to-boostrap-curve-lending-on-arbitrum/22975) that requests 237,500 ARB tokens to support the launch of new Curve lending markets on Arbitrum One, alongside 237,500 ARB from his own pocket.

It’s important to note that Curve DAO got 3,476,795 ARB from the initial distribution and is currently using these funds to incentivize some pools.

### **[RFC] Subsidy Fund for Security Services**

Bernard [submitted an RFC](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-subsidy-fund-for-security-services/22958/1) on behalf of the Arbitrum DAO Procurement Committee (ADPC) that proposes to set up a subsidy fund, seeking $10 million worth of ARB to be administered and selected by the ADPC. These subsidies will be exclusive to a pre-approved whitelisted set of security audit service providers, selected by the ADPC, who will publicly display their fees.

### **[RFC] Defending Open Source: A United Stand for Developer Rights and Software Freedom**

ImmutableLawyer [submitted an RFC](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-defending-open-source-a-united-stand-for-developer-rights-and-software-freedom/23047/1) that proposes a monetary contribution between 1.5M to 2.5M ARB to Coin Center from the ArbitrumDAO to continue their policy, litigation & advocacy efforts in relation to open-source software & software developers’ rights.

### **[RFC] Funding DAO Legal Defence and Advocacy with Defi Education Fund**

GFXLabs [submitted an RFC](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-funding-dao-legal-defence-and-advocacy-with-defi-education-fund/23062/1) that seeks to provide the DeFi Education Fund (DEF), an advocacy organization that focuses specifically on fighting for policy outcomes favorable to decentralized finance developers and users on the ground in Washington DC, with one million ARB across two disbursements to support them in fulfilling their mission.

The post itself contains a lot of information on DEF and a summary of its past efforts.

### **[RFC] Introducing AREA GrantsDAO**

Lumen from Powerhouse [submitted an RFC](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-introducing-area-grantsdao/23022) that describes a potential GrantsDAO, AREA, focused on supporting the development of an open-source software ecosystem on Arbiturm. AREA aims to fund projects that facilitate businesses to operate on-chain. The RFC outlines the structure of the GrantsDAO but it’s not a proposal in and of itself as it doesn’t request approval or funds from the DAO – that will come in a separate proposal according to the post.

### **[RFC] Idea for a Direct User Rewards Program**

AJC [submitted an RFC](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/idea-for-a-direct-user-rewards-program/22939) that seeks to discuss the initiation of a simple rewards program that directly airdrops ARB tokens to users. The goal is to create a long-lasting program that continuously rewards both new and old Arbitrum users. This proposal is currently still in ideation, so the exact details of how this will look are TBD.

### **[RFC] L3 Orbit Ecosystem Fund**

Cryptobyrde [submitted an RFC](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/l3-orbit-ecosystem-fund/22989) that proposes the launch of a 4.9M ARB L3 Orbit Ecosystem Fund for a 1-month trial period.

The Ecosystem Fund would use the funds to:

- Provide liquidity for ARB-(project token) on Arbitrum L2 linearly to Bridged TVL
- Provide liquidity mining for ARB-(project token) on Arbitrum L2 linearly to Bridged TVL
- Buy the project token on Arbitrum L2 linearly to L3 chain activity

### **Delegate Incentive Program Results (MARCH 2024)**

SeedGOV [published the results](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegate-incentive-program-results-march-2024/23043) of the Delegate Incentive Program for March. Out of the 40 participants that enrolled, 38 met the necessary requirements to qualify.

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

There are several proposals being discussed at the same time and we'd love to learn how we can help each and every one of them. On top of that, through the onboarding working group we [announced last week](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-onboarding-working-group-experiment/22849/11) there might be synergies worth exploring between current initiatives and people who are interested in contributing to the DAO.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss all of the above and more during our [Arbitrum Office Hours](https://meet.google.com/jkj-nnop-arc) every Thursday at 3 pm UTC.

## **Uniswap**

### **Temp Check - Onboard Uniswap to Sei**

The [proposal to deploy Uniswap on Sei](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/deploy-uniswap-v3-on-sei/23471) was optimistically approved after the 7-day RFC period and there is now a vote to determine the size of the UNI onboarding package for the deployment, if any.

The [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswapgovernance.eth/proposal/0xe7274e00eb2a084cdc3b7510a8b40aa303ac2d7944e9706ad090c974c76e71bf) ends on April 8 2024 at 8:09 pm UTC

### **[RFC] Gasless Voting for Uniswap DAO on Tally**

Coolhorsegirl [submitted an RFC](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/gasless-voting-for-uniswap-dao-on-tally/23556) that seeks to propose a partnership between Tally and Uniswap to fund a budget for gasless voting and execute voting transactions via a relayer service.

The requested budget is 32 ETH to be used to cover gas for approximately 1 year, and $20,000 as compensation for Tally.

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

Voting on mainet can be expensive which acts as a deterrent for governance participation. Making voting cheaper or completely free can help increase participation, which in turn will help the DAO grow. We’re keen to discuss with other delegates what the most viable solution is for decreasing voting costs for participants of Uniswap DAO.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss the above and more during our [Uniswap Office Hours](https://meet.google.com/twm-jafw-esn) every Friday at 3 pm UTC.
