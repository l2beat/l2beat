### **[RFC] The Watchdog: Arbitrum DAO’s Grant Misuse Bounty Program**

Entropy [submitted an RFC](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/the-watchdog-arbitrum-daos-grant-misuse-bounty-program/27978) that seeks to introduce a grant misuse bounty program dubbed “The Watchdog” to incentivize the identification and reporting of misused DAO-allocated funds. The proposal requests earmarking a total of 520,000 ARB for the initiative, with 500,000 available to reward valid reports and up to 20,000 ARB to cover a minimum of 50 hours of the ARDC Research member that will work on verifying the reports. Note that this amount is not necessarily going to be spent, but it’s just earmarked for use.


### **[RFC] Arbitrum Strategic Objective Setting (SOS) – Defining the DAO’s Interim Goals**

Entropy [submitted an RFC](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-strategic-objective-setting-sos-defining-the-dao-s-interim-goals/28102) that builds on top of their successful proposal to ‘[Unify Arbitrum’s Mission, Vision Purpose](https://v1.snapshot.box/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xf5fdce242b85134153397754d25a43a49611a3e8a1c73b2e11a67e864c56e022)’ and seeks to introduce the Strategic Objective Setting (SOS), an initiative through which DAO members will be able to propose and vote on a cohesive set of short- to mid-term objectives in a collective, inclusive, and adaptable way.

If the proposal passes temp-check, delegates will have a chance to submit a proposed set of short- and medium-term objectives in a 30-day window. After the submission window closes, there will be 21 days of feedback, followed by 14 days of revisions, before eventually going to a 7-day voting period.


### **[RFC] Proposal for Piloting Enhancements and Strengthening the Sustainability of ArbitrumHub in the Year Ahead**

ArbitrtumHub [submitted an RFC](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-proposal-for-piloting-enhancements-and-strengthening-the-sustainability-of-arbitrumhub-in-the-year-ahead/28055), which is the third revision of their [original proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-arbitrumhub-evolution-the-next-step-in-streamlining-information-access-and-raising-awareness-for-arbitrum-dao/24857), after incorporating feedback from delegates. The main difference from the previous iteration is the limiting of the proposed scope for the first year, which has also greatly affected the cost (from the original $470,000 requested, down to $230,000 now).


### **[RFC] DePolis, collective sensemaking for Arbitrum DAO**

DePolis [submitted an RFC](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-depolis-collective-sensemaking-for-arbitrum-dao/28076/1) to propose creating a decentralized version of Polis, an open-source technology for survey research that uses data science to gather insights, for the Arbitrum DAO. The proposal requests a total of $65,000 (paid in ARB) with $5,000 going to user incentives and the rest going to the development team.


### **[RFC] Arbitrum Sponsorship at RWA Paris 2025**

Rafalovic [submitted an RFC](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-arbitrum-sponsorship-at-rwa-paris-2025/28086) to propose that Arbitrum DAO sponsors RWA Paris 2025, a flagship stage of NFT Paris focused on spotlighting tokenization and decentralized finance that is set to take place on February 13-14. The requested amount of sponsorship is a total of 65,000€ (~ $66,500), and it would get Arbitrum:



* Prominent placement of Arbitrum’s logo on the RWA Paris main stage backdrop.
* Exclusive access to a 300m² balcony for private networking with catered breakfast and branded setup.


### **Non-emergency actions to facilitate key rotation of Security Council - December 2024**

On December 21, 2024, Arbitrum Foundation [published a post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-emergency-actions-to-facilitate-key-rotation-of-security-council-december-2024/27973) announcing that the Security Council would be performing a non-emergency action to enable the non-emergency path to perform key rotations for four members. The rotation concluded on January 9, 2025 successfully.


### **GCP EOY Update and Transparency Report**

Djinn [published a post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/gcp-eoy-update-and-transparency-report/28024/1) on behalf of the Gaming Catalyst Program (GCP) team with an end-of-year update and transparency report. The report is too comprehensive for the scope of this review, but we encourage you to read it so you can be up-to-date with GCP. You can also find the [full transparency report here](https://docsend.com/view/8bnfviruwfc4igjp).


### **STEP Report - December 2024**

Steakhouse, the program manager for Arbitrum’s Stable Treasury Endowment Program (STEP), [published its monthly report](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/step-report-december-2024/28094) for STEP’s performance in December 2024.

### **[RFC] NERITE x UNI: Pilot Program**

Alphagrowth [submitted an RFC](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/nerite-x-uni-pilot-program/25143) presenting the opportunity for the DAO to list $UNI as collateral on Nerite and use Nerite in the DAO’s treasury management strategies. 

The Nerite Pilot Program offers the Uniswap DAO strategic opportunities to initiate treasury strategies on Nerite by considering one of the following conservative deposit options:



* Deposit $5M, Borrow and Stake $1M USDN.
* Deposit $10M, Borrow and Stake $2M USDN.

## **Polygon**


### **Polygon Feature Requests**

H_Rook, the Governance Lead at Polygon Labs, [published a guide](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/polygon-feature-requests/20493) to creating Polygon Feature Requests (PFRs). While it does not constitute a proscribed process and is not part of the PIP governance framework, it is intended to provide a helpful set of standards that any stakeholder in the Polygon ecosystem can use to put forward high-level ideas. The post includes a template that prospective PFR authors can use.


### **[RFC] Reassign Upgradeability Rights of Polygon PoS Contracts to Protocol Council**

H_Rook, the Governance Lead at Polygon Labs, [submitted a proposal](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-54-reassign-upgradeability-rights-of-polygon-pos-contracts-to-protocol-council/20350) that seeks to replace all rights of the legacy multisigs, amongst those the ability to upgrade staking and bridge smart contracts of the Polygon PoS chain, with the Protocol Council multisig contracts introduced in PIP-29, which consist of a set of 2 Safe multisig smart contracts:



* Protocol Council Standard route, requiring 7 of 13 consensus of the Protocol Council with a 10-day timelock.
* Protocol Council Emergency route, requiring 10 of 13 consensus of the Protocol Council without a timelock.


### **[RFC] Jorvik Hardfork**

Raneet from Polygon Labs [submitted an RFC](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-53-jorvik-hardfork/20357) that specifies the changes included in the Polygon PoS hard fork named Jorvik.

## **Starknet**


### **Learning from Staking V1: A Discussion on Commission Policy and Stake Distribution**

NatanSW [published a post](https://community.starknet.io/t/learning-from-staking-v1-a-discussion-on-commission-policy-and-stake-distribution/115163) to discuss the challenges of validators competing at 0% commission and the growing concerns about stake centralization and gather feedback on potential solutions. Some of the proposed solutions include:



* Commission Increase
    * Currently, validators’ commission rates can only decrease, which limits their flexibility in responding to market dynamics.
* Centralization commission rule
    * For example, if a validator accumulates more than X (10% for example) of the total staked amount, an additional Y% (5% for example) commission could be added for each percentage point above the threshold

Baer from DAOplomats, the Treasury Officer of the GTF, [published a financial update](https://forum.connext.network/t/everclear-dao-financial-updates-from-daoplomats/1254/5) for the DAO. Since the DAO didn’t have any treasury transactions in December, they took the liberty to create a token flow report for 2024.

### **WIP: Delegate Code of Conduct**

Blockworks Research [published a post](https://forum.wormhole.com/t/wip-delegate-code-of-conduct/360) that seeks to open the discussion for the creation of a Delegate Code of Conduct in Womrhole to spark mature governance procedures and discussion within the DAO. The proposed principles include:



* Due Care and Attention
* Civility

## **ZkSync**

ZkSync starts the year with a bang with multiple proposals to vote on and plenty of discussions taking place.


## Active Votes

[[GAP-1] ZKsync Token Program Priorities 2025 Endorsement](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/zksync/proposal/13823050748058617424077595486689751986818771098977300222700522842013613046754?govId=eip155:324:0x496869a7575A1f907D1C5B1eca28e4e9E382afAb) – ends on January 22 at 10:25 UTC

### **[GAP-1] ZKsync Token Program Priorities 2025 Endorsement**

Rafa [published a proposal](https://forum.zknation.io/t/gap-1-zksync-token-program-priorities-2025-endorsement/387) on behalf of the ZKsync Governance Team that seeks to ratify the ZKsync Token Program Priorities for 2025,  facilitating better impact and effectiveness for ZK token allocations by the Token Assembly.

In a nutshell, all ZK token allocations will prioritize bringing to reality ZKsync’s elastic network, an ever-expanding network of customizable chains. This includes three components: accelerating ZKsync protocol development, establishing the network of ZK Chains, and creating the home for Elastic Apps powered by ZKsync.


### **Catalyst: Incentivising Network Growth with Token Programs**

Drnick [published a post](https://forum.zknation.io/t/catalyst-incentivising-network-growth-with-token-programs/401) expanding on the approach of TPPs (see his [previous post](https://forum.zknation.io/t/token-programmes-as-a-path-towards-a-true-cybernetic-governance-framework/142/14)) and proposed a program of action that directly targets the application layer: Catalyst. Catalyst is a Token Program Proposal (TPP) specifically tailored to incentivize and grow consumer-facing apps on ZKsync-powered chains. It aligns rewards with on-chain performance, ensuring that only apps delivering real engagement and adoption unlock further tokens.

Although not a solid proposal in terms of timeline, budget, people to lead the initiative, etc - Catalyst is an important step towards reaching an agreement on the direction of the actions we should take as a DAO.


### **TPP - AAVE DAO Airdrop Claim Extension Request**

ACI [submitted a proposal](https://forum.zknation.io/t/tpp-aave-dao-airdrop-claim-extension-request/423) on behalf of AAVE DAO that requests a capped minter of 8,301,475 ZK, as allocated but not claimed from the ZK airdrop with ZK to be distributed to AAVE users and partner protocols on ZKsync.

The reason for the proposal is that the tokens were initially allocated to the Aave Collector Contract address on ZKsync and a full AIP on-chain proposal was required to claim them, which hasn’t been a trivial development task. As a result, the claim window was missed.


### **ZK Capped Minter V2: Nested Minters, Start Time, Expiration, Pause, and Cancel**

Rafa [published a post](https://forum.zknation.io/t/zk-capped-minter-v2-nested-minters-start-time-expiration-pause-and-cancel/417) announcing the deployment of the ZK Capped Minter V2 and its associated Factory contract on ZKsync Era. The new minter enhances the token governance framework, particularly in the execution of Token Program Proposals (TPPs) with new features such as:



* Multiple Minters
* Nested Minters
* Start and expiration dates
* Pause and Cancel Operations
* Metadata
* Events

For new TPPs, proposal authors are encouraged to use the new version of the capped minter. For more information on the new features, please read the full post.


### **ZKsync Ignite Program Update From OpenBlock Labs - Saturday Jan. 4th 2024**

With the ZKsync Ignite program having started on January 6th, 0xk3y from OpenBlock Labs [published the first bi-weekly period ZK allocations](https://forum.zknation.io/t/zksync-ignite-program-update-from-openblock-labs-saturday-jan-4th-2024/402), which have been approved by the DeFi Steering Committee (DSC). The total amount of ZK allocated in the first bi-weekly period is 6,941,926.15 ZK.

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

We’re interested in discussing the token priorities proposed by the ZKsync Governance Team, as well as the Catalyst program proposed by Drnick with other delegates and interested stakeholders.

### **Growing Scroll’s Founder Ecosystem**

Emjlin [published a post](https://forum.scroll.io/t/growing-scrolls-founder-ecosystem/418) to announce that Scroll’s growth team launched Scroll Open and Scroll Campus - an opportunity for devs to:



* Build soft skills needed to launch apps, find users, and get funding
* Fly to Malaysia and work directly with like-minded builders and the Scroll team

You can find more information at [open.scroll.io](open.scroll.io).

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

We’re interested in discussing the active proposal and getting other delegates’ view of it, but we’re also happy to discuss anything else relevant to Scroll.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss all the above and more during our [L2BEAT Governance Office Hours](https://meet.google.com/twm-jafw-esn) every Friday at 4 pm UTC.
