## **Optimism**

### **On Chain Vote - Governor Upgrade #1: Improve advanced delegation voting**

Kent, the CTO of Agora, [submitted a proposal](https://gov.optimism.io/t/proposal-improve-advanced-delegation-voting/7932) to upgrade the governor contracts to enable voters with advanced delegated voting power to cast their votes in a single transaction. This enhancement addresses user feedback on the advanced delegation feature, simplifying the voting process.

The [Agora vote](https://vote.optimism.io/proposals/63758762292293008954414933414904836930778692439616923618399126968620365661274) ends on April 17 2024 at 9:06 pm UTC.

### **On Chain Vote - Season 5: Intents Budget Proposal #2**

Gonna, the Grants Council lead, [submitted a proposal](https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-5-intents-budget-proposal-2/7937) that proposes using the 1.040.000 OP intended to return to the Gov Fund and to allocate it to 7 mission requests. Additionally, the proposal seeks to get approval for the GC to allocate an additional 1M OP, which has already been approved by Token House, to 4 mission requests.

The [Agora vote](https://vote.optimism.io/proposals/79153197521552675573175103134699879266644135524341625272698131484806349525411) ends on April 17 2024 at 8:43 pm UTC.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss all of the above and more during our [Optimism Office Hours](https://meet.google.com/pem-jzrh-gkq) every Tuesday at 3 pm UTC.

## **Arbitrum**

### **Security Council Elections**

Security Council nominees [have completed their compliance check](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/march-2024-election-compliance/23159) and we’re ready to move to the member election process. The [elections begin on April 12th](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/council/security-council/election/1/round-1) and will conclude on May 3rd, giving delegates 3 weeks to cast their vote.

However, it’s important to note that the voting process is designed to encourage delegates to cast their vote(s) early as their voting power will eventually decay if they do not cast their vote within the first 7 days. As a reminder, delegates can split their votes across multiple nominees, with 1 token representing 1 vote.

### **LTIPP Applications Vote**

The LTIPP Council has finished reviewing applications and after internally voting on which ones will move forward, there are 77 applications currently [up for a vote on Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth). The ones up for a vote are the ones the Council has provided a recommendation for (while their feedback can [be found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LnqTiR8t_crKYDeWEYBILiT0-fuWQVSdNiwrZeIFf2A/edit#heading=h.e6uvha41l4gr)) but any protocol that didn’t get the Council recommendation can still go for a vote if they find a delegate with over 500,000 of voting power willing to “sponsor” their application and put it up to Snapshot.

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

L2BEAT’s co-founder Bartek Kiepuszewski is a Security Council nominee and was also a part of the previous cohort. We’d love to answer any questions or address any concerns you might have regarding his application. We’re also very interested in discussing the implications of LTIPP and all other incentive programs for protocols that did not get any funds from the DAO.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss all of the above and more during our [Arbitrum Office Hours](https://meet.google.com/jkj-nnop-arc) every Thursday at 3 pm UTC.

## **Uniswap**

### **Temp Check - Update Uni v3/v2 Deployment Process (March 2024)**

[This proposal](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/update-uni-v3-v2-deployment-process-march-2024/23468) by Abdullah Umar seeks to give the Uniswap Accountability Committee multisig agency over altering the v3-deployments.uniswap.eth & v2deployments.uniswap.eth subdomains This will allow the Committee to edit these text records whenever a new v3/v2 deployment is complete without having to go through an on-chain vote.

The [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswapgovernance.eth/proposal/0xaf3965fdf77423bcc7a27294c90a3522b13ae267519c277f6740a7a39869b120) ends on April 16 2024 at 6 pm UTC.

### **[RFC] Supporting the DeFi Education Fund**

MillerDEF from the DeFi Education Fund (DEF) [submitted an RFC](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-supporting-the-defi-education-fund/23631) that seeks to request Uniswap’s monetary support. The RFC contains countless examples of the DEF’s past accomplishments that would justify the request.

### **Uniswap Treasury Working Group (UTWG) Application**

Following a successful tempcheck to establish the Uniswap Treasury Working Group (UTWG), the [applications for people interested in participating in the group have opened](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-treasury-working-group-utwg-application/23571) and will conclude on April 14th.

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

Organizations like DEF are doing a very difficult job which is an immense help for everyone involved in the web3 space. We’d be really keen to discuss with other delegates and governance participants how we can best support them.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss all the above and more during our [Uniswap Office Hours](https://meet.google.com/twm-jafw-esn) every Friday at 3 pm UTC.

## **Hop**

### **Hop Protocol & DAO Report**

Francom, the Head of DAO Ops, [published a quarterly report](https://forum.hop.exchange/t/hop-protocol-dao-report/1145) on the progress of Hop Protocol, which highlights key advancements achieved over the past quarter, from technical upgrades to protocol and DAO growth.

### **[RFC] HOP Single-Sided Liquidity**

Elchungus [submitted an RFC](https://forum.hop.exchange/t/rfc-hop-single-sided-liquidity/1144) that proposes the DAO should LP 25,000,000 HOP as single-sided liquidity in the HOP/ETH 0.30% Univ3 pool on Ethereum to increase HOP liquidity and market depth while providing a natural source of diversification for the DAO.

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

There’s already a treasury diversification initiative being worked on which we think could take the proposal for single-sided liquidity into consideration and offer us insights into the potential implications that could have for the DAO and HOP’s token. We’d be interested in discussing it further with other delegates and Elchungus, as well as 0xLev1 who is spearheading the treasury management framework.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss all the above and more during our [Hop Office Hours](https://meet.google.com/twm-jafw-esn) every Friday at 3 pm UTC.

## **Polygon**

### **Polygon Funding Proposal Framework**

0xJustice from Polygon Labs [introduced the framework of Polygon Funding Proposals (PFPs)](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pfp-1-polygon-funding-proposal-framework/13759) for the Polygon Community Treasury. A PFP is a formal proposal proposing changes to the Community Treasury’s governance processes - anyone can submit a PFP, which is the first step towards building consensus.

However, in the initial phase of the PFP framework, only Treasury Board (see below) proposals will be merged into the repository. As the Community Treasury evolves, other types of PFPs may be proposed, e.g., funding proposals.

### **Community Treasury Board**

[This proposal introduces the Community Treasury Board](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pfp-2-community-treasury-board/13760) (CTB) as an independent governance body responsible for managing the Community Treasury. This includes but isn’t limited to, creating a Community Treasury strategy and post-season impact reports, approving grants and expenses, and managing a budget.

This proposal distinguishes two tracks that the CTB may employ:

The Direct Funding track, which facilitates submissions from individual projects to the CTB.

The Grant Allocator track, which relies on specialized entities facilitating the distribution of allocated funds to grantees..

### **Initial Set of CTB Members**

[This PFP](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pfp-3-initial-set-of-ctb-members/13761) proposes five members to the inaugural Community Treasury Board to administer the operations, strategy, and transparency of the funding mechanism.

The proposed members are:

[David Gogel](https://twitter.com/dgogel) from dYdX Foundation

[Peter Kim](https://twitter.com/petejkim), the creator of Coinbase Wallet

[Maggie Love](https://twitter.com/maggielove_) from SheFi

[Ajit Tripathi](https://twitter.com/chainyoda) from Hadron Founders Club

[Roc Zacharias](https://twitter.com/CryptoRocky) from Quickswap

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

The Community Treasury Board is a solid first step to opening up the doors for growth and innovation in Polygon’s DAO. Having a framework through which we can fund different proposals will help attract more contributors and builders to Polygon. We’d love to discuss how we can get involved and help move things forward.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss all the above and more during our [Polygon Office Hours](https://meet.google.com/avz-chuc-ksa) every Friday at 3 pm UTC.

## **Connext**

### **Vote - Extend 3 months the current Security Council**

[This proposal](https://forum.connext.network/t/rfc-extend-current-security-council-and-upgrade-the-election-process/1125) by MinstroDolar proposes an extension of 3 months to the initial Security Council given that the 6-month bootstrapping phase has ended on March 5, 2024, and we need to first agree on the details of the next election before we begin the process.

The [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/dao.connext.eth/proposal/0x49b1a9a5d95c05da403660b677bfee498793dc243b3bd7e5554e7fda636c3b22) ends on April 14 2024 at 11:20 pm UTC.

### **[RFC] Research and Comparative Analysis Report of the ERC-7281 (xERC-20) Standard**

Ethereum 2077 [submitted an RFC](https://forum.connext.network/t/rfc-executable-cgp-9-research-and-comparative-analysis-report-of-the-erc-7281-xerc-20-standard-by-ethereum-2077/1144) that seeks to conduct an in-depth analysis and write a comprehensive report on ERC-7281 (xERC-20), a standard vital for cross-chain token interoperability. The project aims to provide the Ethereum developer community and stakeholders with a detailed understanding of xERC-20, comparing it with alternative standards and highlighting its potential in advancing blockchain interoperability.

The work is expected to take four weeks to complete, and the amount requested by Ethereum 77 is a total of 65,000 $NEXT, paid half up-front and half midway through the engagement.

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

The Security Council is an important part of Connext’s DAO and making sure we have a solid election process in place before moving to replace the current cohort makes sense. We’re happy to discuss with other delegates how we can best proceed forward on that front.

We’d also like to understand the benefits of an analysis and report of the xERC20 standard for the Connext DAO.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss all the above and more during our [Connext Office Hours](https://meet.google.com/twm-jafw-esn) every Friday at 3 pm UTC.
