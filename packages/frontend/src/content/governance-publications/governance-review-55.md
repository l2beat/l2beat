## **Optimism**


## **Active Votes**

[Season 8 and 9 Milestone and Metrics Council Selection](https://vote.optimism.io/proposals/3505139576575581948952533286313165208104296221987341923460133599388956364165) - ends on June 11 at 18:00 UTC.

## **Season 7 Guest Voter Selection Experiment Outcomes**

The Optimism Foundation [has created a post](https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-7-guest-voter-selection-experiment-outcomes/9972) outlining the results of Season 7’s “Guest Voter” experiment. Survey and on-chain data show two clear participant clusters rather than the four researchers expected:

*   Cluster A (114 people) mirrored existing Citizens, set conservative Retro Funding budgets, and mostly backed the Collective’s growth-first remit.
    
*   Cluster B (38 people) prioritised public-goods spending, pushed much higher budgets (especially outside Season 7’s scope), and said they’d devote nearly double the weekly time to governance.    

The strongest predictors were values, not roles: agreement with “public goods over Superchain growth” and a history of significant Retro Funding awards both drove Cluster B membership. Builder turnout remained low, and three projects coordinated their ballots internally, hinting at strategic voting.

Recommended next steps: lower voter-experience friction, give organisations a direct vote, weight stakeholder groups to offset participation bias, use OP Stack scores as expertise signals, empower the Budget Board with optimistic approvals, and add guardrails to stop mission scope-creep.

### **Anticapture Commission - Season 7 Retrospective**

ACC (Optimism’s Anti-Capture Commission) [has created a post](https://gov.optimism.io/t/anticapture-commission-season-7-retrospective/9973) outlining its Season 7 retrospective. The 26-member council met every KPI it set: it scrutinized six upgrade votes for capture risk, cast signatures and snapshot ballots on time, and maintained an open alert line to the Citizens’ House, although no red flags were raised. Operational frictions, however, were apparent. A supersized membership left most of the workload to a small core, the dual Snapshot-plus-Safe workflow felt redundant, and early-season signer-removal hiccups burned days. For Season 8, the ACC suggests trimming to ~12 delegates, raising the Safe threshold, replacing Snapshot with quick Telegram polls, scheduling only one mid-season meeting, and adding a formal capture-risk scorecard, as well as a mid-season window to tweak internal procedures. Three long-term paths are floated: a lean “call-when-needed” watchdog, an on-chain kill-switch authority shared with the Security Council, or a small research unit building real-time capture dashboards.

### **Eden Fractal Epoch 2: Implementing Fractal Decision-Making on the Superchain**

Optimystics created a [post that shows](https://gov.optimism.io/t/eden-fractal-epoch-2-implementing-fractal-decision-making-on-the-superchain/9976) “Eden Fractal Epoch 2,” a Base-deployed push to turn three years of fractal governance experiments into live Superchain tooling. Beginning June 5, the group will host bi-weekly “Respect Game” sessions (Thursdays at 17:00 UTC), where builders earn non-transferable tokens, demo projects in breakout rooms, and submit proposals for follow-up Eden Town Hall debates. Epoch 2 upgrades include ORDAO-based voting, a Respect-token migration on Base, refreshed Fractalgram tooling, and a pilot for democratic fund distribution, all designed to provide Superchain teams with plug-and-play coordination modules. Related spin-offs, Optimism Fractal, Optimism Town Hall, and the new ORDAO Fractal—run on alternating Thursdays, with a shared calendar for RSVPs.

### **Grants Council Wider Picture (Season 6 & 7)**

SEEDGov [created a post](https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-council-wider-picture-season-6-7/9977/1) that provides a data-rich overview of the Grants Council’s evolution in Seasons 6 and 7.

*   Season 6: A 16-member council split into four specialist teams processed 344 applications; 122 were funded (35% approval), with 74% of the OP going to Superchain-security grants.
    
*   Season 7: the mandate narrowed to TVL growth, the roster shrank to eight reviewers, and the bar rose sharply—220 applications produced just 19 grants (9 % approval) as budgets tightened from 4.7 M OP in the first cycle to 0.24 M OP by the fourth. Audit requests gained prominence, and unspent funds were rolled back to the treasury.
    

The analysis highlights a deliberate shift from broad mission coverage to targeted, high-impact funding, advising future applicants to align early with Council priorities and apply when budgets are fullest.

### **\[DRAFT\] Budget Board Advisory Proposal for the DAO Operating Budget for Seasons 8 and 9**

Danelund.eth [created a post](https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-budget-board-advisory-proposal-for-the-dao-operating-budget-for-seasons-8-and-9/9985) that shows the Budget Board’s draft operating budget advice for Seasons 8 & 9. The goal is to create a 2.3M OP ceiling for all council spending over the next 12 months, approximately 25.8% of the protocol’s trailing-year revenue, while providing leads with a 0.8% headroom to support credible growth or retroactive pay for performers. The Board forecasts a multi-year glide path that gradually reduces operations to 12% of revenue and requests a one-time $80,000 operating pot to cover its data and tooling. A final proposal is due on June 12; comments will remain open until then.

### **Proposal to direct the Arbitrum Foundation to implement an extended version of EIP-7907. And for the DAO to ratify its deployment on Arbitrum One**

Cupojoseph [created a post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-proposal-to-direct-the-arbitrum-foundation-to-implement-an-extended-version-of-eip-7907-and-for-the-dao-to-ratify-its-deployment-on-arbitrum-one/29375/1) asking the DAO to task the Arbitrum Foundation with researching, and eventually shipping, an “extended” version of EIP-7907 that would lift Arbitrum One’s 24 KB contract-size ceiling far beyond the 256 KB limit slated for Ethereum. Bigger binaries would unlock richer on-chain NFTs, AI-powered contracts, and other code-heavy use cases, keeping Arbitrum competitive with developer-friendly L2s such as MegaETH and RISE. The request is for Offchain Labs/AF to study how large bytecode can be safely implemented, incorporate the change into the next ArbOS upgrade, and submit the result to a DAO ratification vote. After receiving feedback from OCL, the author concedes that the roll-out should wait until Ethereum activates 7907 for backward compatibility, but urges the community to signal support now and provide the Foundation with any additional R&D budget it may need. Comments from builders who bump against today’s limit are especially welcome.

### **AIP: Remove Cost Cap on Arbitrum Nova**

The Arbitrum Foundation [created a post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/constitutional-aip-remove-cost-cap-on-arbitrum-nova/29332) outlining an AIP to scrap Nova’s “Amortized Cost Cap,” allowing batch posters to reclaim 100% of their L1 data fees for the first time. Because EIP-4844 narrowed Nova’s cost edge to ~2×, and Orbit chains now handle the ultra-cheap use cases, the Foundation argues that the cap only forces it to subsidize deficits and distorts real usage. Flipping the cap parameter to 0 bips would shift those costs back to users, end the Foundation’s top-ups, and acknowledge Nova’s lower strategic priority. The change requires its own Snapshot (95% FOR, 100M quorum) before proceeding to a joint Tally execution with other maintenance items.

### **Entropy Advisors Monthly Update: May 2025**

Entropy Advisors [created a post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/entropy-advisors-monthly-update-may-2025/29387) with its May 2025 progress report and June game plan for Arbitrum DAO. Highlights: Stylus Sprint milestones continue to roll in; OpCo operations have shifted primarily to the new Oversight & Transparency Committee; the Watchdog whistle-blowing program is now funded and is installing a GlobaLeaks portal; and 22 research pieces, budget tweaks, and treasury deployments (TMC, GMC, STEP 2) are progressing through governance. Entropy also tabled two big structural moves: a single Treasury Management Council to replace TMC/GMC/STEP and a proposal to wind down the Multisig Support Service, and is shepherding DRIP incentives, SOS objective-setting, and ARDC research while pumping out dashboards (Timeboost, Pectra, Fluid, USD.ai) for data-driven oversight.

Looking ahead to June, the team aims to: ratify the new Treasury Council on Snapshot, push DRIP and STEP 2 funds on-chain, launch the Watchdog portal, publish a revised Events budget, release updates to the Delegate Code of Conduct, and submit Entropy’s following engagement proposal. They’ll also finish MEV analyses, expand RWA analytics, and begin an Arbitrum ecosystem overview dashboard—all while holding bi-weekly office hours for delegate requests.

### **Proposal: Launch Native $ARB Staking at ≈ 8% APY**

Masha [created a post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-launch-native-arb-staking-at-8-apy/29399) with the idea of launching a protocol-native $ARB staking module that would pay a fixed ~8 % APY. Under the plan, holders lock $ARB to secure the network and gain full governance rights, while a liquid staking token (stARB) preserves flexibility through auto-compounding via Tally. Supporters claim that the yield would transform $ARB into a true yield-bearing asset, reduce circulating supply, and position Arbitrum as the only L2 offering predictable on-chain returns, all while deepening delegate engagement and appealing to institutional DeFi funds.

### **Updating the OpCo Foundation’s Operational Capability**

The Arbitrum team [created a post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/updating-the-opco-foundation-s-operational-capability/29388) outlining a slate of fixes to enable the newly elected OpCo Foundation to operate effectively. Key tweaks would (1) let OpCo sign its service-provider contracts and tap spare treasury for pilot work instead of begging the DAO each time; (2) reshape the 4M ARB “bonus” bucket into a wider token-comp/bonus pool set by the OAT; (3) loosen OAT election rules so only one seat per firm is allowed—no blanket ban on people who already hold other DAO roles—and move “potential” conflicts to private disclosure; (4) stop hard-wiring OpCo to just “ecosystem support/treasury” so it can pursue any initiative likely to benefit the DAO. Two governance calls (6 & 9 June) will gather feedback, with a Snapshot vote tentatively slated for 12 June.

### **Reallocate Redeemed USDM Funds to STEP 2 Budget**

Entropy [created a post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/reallocate-redeemed-usdm-funds-to-step-2-budget/29335) with a purely administrative shuffle: moving the approximately $3.5 million in USDC that the Foundation just redeemed from the now-defunct USDM stablecoin directly into STEP 2’s already-approved RWA basket (WisdomTree WTGXX 30%, Spiko USTBL 35%, Franklin Templeton BENJI 35%). Nothing new is being spent—this simply gets the cash back to work at ~4.5 % instead of sitting idle.

## **Uniswap**

### **\[RFC\] Uniswap Unichain - USDS and sUSDS Co-Incentives Growth Management Plan**

Doo from StableLab [created an RFC](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-uniswap-unichain-usds-and-susds-co-incentives-growth-management-plan/25650) with a plan to launch a KPI-tied co-incentive program for USDS and its yield-bearing sibling, sUSDS, on Uniswap’s Unichain. The ask is $1M in fixed funding plus up to $3M unlocked only when supply milestones are met (≥ $20M, $50M, $100M TVL), with 80% of every tranche routed directly to protocol-matched rewards and 20% reserved for coordination and reporting. StableLab will strike deals with lending/AMM partners (e.g., Euler, Compound) to amplify Sky’s 4.5% base yield on sUSDS, then present a new incentive schedule for delegates to ratify each month via Snapshot. Performance dashboards will track TVL retention, new LPs, and ROI ($12 TVL per $1 spent). Target outcome: Scale USDS and sUSDS to a nine-figure level and kick-start broader DeFi activity beyond existing Uniswap pools on Unichain.

## **Polygon**

### **PIP-67: Update Membership of the Protocol Council**

Kb17 [created a post](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-67-update-membership-of-the-protocol-council/21007) outlining PIP-67, a draft Polygon Improvement Proposal that refreshes the 13-member Protocol Council, first formed under PIP-29. Two long-standing signers, Justin Drake and Anthony Sassano, have stepped down with their full consent. Security specialists Pablo Sabbatella (Opsek, Optimism Security Council) and Jack Sanford (Sherlock co-founder) have been nominated to fill the vacated seats. In parallel, Polygon Labs is replacing its two individual seats with separate 5-of-8 multisigs run by the Labs Engineering and Labs Security teams, keeping signer voting thresholds, timelocks, and contract logic unchanged. The authors argue that the shuffle maintains decentralisation, jurisdictional diversity, and operational readiness as the Council prepares to take over faster, more autonomous upgrade duties proposed in PIP-54. All other rules from PIP-29 remain in force; only the signer roster is updated.

### **PIP-68: Reform Key Polygon PoS Multisigs to Integrate Protocol Council Members**

Kb17 [created a post](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-68-reform-key-polygon-pos-multisigs-to-integrate-protocol-council-members/21008) outlining PIP-68, a draft proposal to hand control of Polygon PoS’s two critical upgrade multisigs to the newly refreshed 13-member Protocol Council. The change preserves the wallets’ addresses and ten-day timelock. Still, it replaces the old signers with the Council roster approved in PIP-67 and increases the threshold to seven out of thirteen signatures. On Ethereum, the Council multisig will now own root-chain admin knobs, such as checkpoint cadence, exit-period tweaks, and validator data migrations. On Polygon PoS, it will take over upgrade authority for ChildChainManagerProxy, EIP-1559Burn, and allied contracts, inheriting every privileged role the legacy signers previously held. Authors argue that this preserves hard-won security practices while deepening decentralization: governance procedures remain identical, only the signer set and threshold evolve.

## **Starknet**

### **Become a Starknet Delegate – Help Shape the Future of the Network**

0xBeja [created a post](https://community.starknet.io/t/become-a-starknet-delegate-help-shape-the-future-of-the-network/115599/1) inviting everyone to Starknet’s open call for fresh governance delegates ahead of the following voting cycle. Applicants who complete the Foundation’s short form can receive delegated STRK, giving them real voting weight on SNIPs and protocol changes. Ideal candidates are already active in Forum or X discussions, have voted in past rounds (or are eager to participate), and can bring geographic, technical, or educational diversity to the decision-making process. Delegates are expected to cast votes, publish rationales, and serve as a transparent voice for the wider community; those who demonstrate strong, consistent participation can advance to higher delegation tiers over time.

### **Proposal for StarkWare’s participation in Starknet staking mechanism during v2 - Feedback request**

Manor [created a post](https://community.starknet.io/t/proposal-for-starkwares-participation-in-starknet-staking-mechanism-during-v2-feedback-request/115607) that describes StarkWare’s draft plan for joining Starknet’s v2 staking phase and invites the community to provide feedback and refine it. StarkWare aims to expand the staking pool, distribute voting power, and attract smaller operators by delegating STRK widely across eligible validators, while also operating one validator of its own, capped at 10% of the total stake. The team’s preferred delegation formula for the first six-month season is a flat, fixed amount per qualified validator, assuming they pass KYC/KYB, maintain a 99% uptime, charge no more than a 10% commission, and, from v3 onward, demonstrate their performance on the testnet. StarkWare is testing three allocation models (pure proportional, capped-match plus equal remainder, and equal), but currently leans toward the equal option to maximize decentralization and minimize market distortion. As the validator set grows, the post also flags a forthcoming proposal to adjust the mining-curve constant c upward, ensuring that rewards per staked token do not decline too sharply as the pool expands. Feedback is requested on delegation math, validator requirements, and the reward curve tweak before the plan is finalized for the July-to-December v2 window.

## **Everclear**


### **Votable Supply and Delegate Engagement**

SEEDGov [created a post](https://forum.connext.network/t/votable-supply-and-delegate-engagement/1381) explaining how Clear DAO is struggling to meet quorum and proposes redelegating roughly 25 million idle CLEAR tokens to the most reliable voters. Only 38.5 million of the 62.3 million delegated tokens have voted in the past year, meaning a constitutional proposal would require a 93% turnout from the “active” slice. This standard is impossible to meet given recent participation levels. Eight highly engaged delegates already control 23.9M CLEAR, yet another 18.4M sits with delegates who have never voted. SEEDGov will soon publish a redelegation plan that shifts dormant tokens toward delegates with strong voting records, aiming to easily reach the ordinary quorum and put the 36 M-CLEAR constitutional threshold within reach.

### **RFP: Secondary Governance Interface**

Theshelb [created a post](https://forum.zknation.io/t/rfp-secondary-governance-interface/702) to open an RFP for a new secondary governance interface to replace the deprecated Boardroom portal. The ZKsync Governance Team seeks a vendor that can replicate core Tally functions like system overview, delegation tools with searchable delegate profiles, and full proposal submission and voting, for the three OZ-Governor contracts, on both desktop and mobile platforms. Bidders must submit a proposal document, cost spreadsheet, and mock-up or MVP to gov@zknation.dev by July 31, 2025. The team will respond by August 31 and then negotiate a contract with the chosen provider.

### **Security Council Report: Scroll Mainnet Emergency Upgrade on 2025-05-26**

Haichen [created a post](https://forum.scroll.io/t/security-council-report-scroll-mainnet-emergency-upgrade-on-2025-05-26/810) reporting how the Scroll Security Council hot-patched the mainnet on May 26 after Plonky3 auditors identified two FRI-verifier bugs within the OpenVM prover stack. Because the fix changed the verification key, the council pushed an emergency on-chain upgrade (new verifier contract, same multisig flow) and re-proved pending blocks the same day. No user funds were at risk—sequencer and provers are still permissioned—but Scroll plans multi-proof safeguards before complete decentralization. Credits went to Plonky3 and Axiom for quick disclosure and code fixes.

### **Scroll DAO Delegate Accelerator Program – Execution Plan**

Nneoma\_StableLab [created a post](https://forum.scroll.io/t/scroll-dao-delegate-accelerator-program-execution-plan/826) that shows the execution plan for the recently approved Scroll Delegate Accelerator. Applications to participate as a student are open through June 23; a 15-week schedule follows, covering setup, curriculum development, an 8-week training cohort, and wrap-up. StableLab will run ops, SEEDGov writes the curriculum, Factory Labs handles assessments, and the Scroll Foundation leads comms. Graduates who finish all assignments and hit performance targets can earn POAPs plus up to 5k SCR delegation from a 100k SCR pool drawn from the program’s $ 90k budget.
