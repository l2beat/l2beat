## **Optimism**

Lots of discussions are taking place around the further decentralization of Optimism, with a proposal by Agora to enable onchain treasury execution.


### **[RFC] Governor Update Proposal #3: Enable onchain treasury execution**

Kent, the CEO of Agora, [submitted an RFC](https://gov.optimism.io/t/governor-update-proposal-3-enable-onchain-treasury-execution/9072) that seeks to update the governor contract to allow the direct execution of token transfer proposals onchain. Whereas today, proposals on Optimism are voted onchain, but executed manually by the Optimism Foundation according to the outcome of the vote, this upgrade will make it such that for OP token transfer, proposals are executed fully onchain, automatically, and without relying on the Foundation.


### **Optimism Working Models for Decentralization**

Following the discussion that GFX’s proposal for ‘[Accelerated Decentralization For Optimism](https://gov.optimism.io/t/accelerated-decentralization-proposal-for-optimism/8875)’ sparked, the Optimism Foundation [published a post](https://gov.optimism.io/t/optimism-working-models-for-decentralization/9054) outlining the working models intended to narrow the gap between them and the community on the Collective’s path to decentralization.



* [Decentralization Milestone Working Model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IpL0oTd3AgNBu_eWdjP9EjbQfZjq-_Nd3yU1H2ke3vY/edit?usp=sharing)
* [Decision Diagram Working Model](https://www.figma.com/board/iXqyKmLJeBeplKpJBHDI7G/PUBLIC%3A-Optimism-Decision-Diagram-Working-Model?node-id=0-1&t=hzXOQarjkYPxhSyZ-1)  (+ [Decision Design Framework](https://plaid-cement-e44.notion.site/Decision-Design-Framework-1115831e345280adb395f8de80e5a008?pvs=4))

These working models are not intended to be roadmaps. Instead, they are intended to preserve flexibility and allow the community to collaborate with the Optimism Foundation in testing, adapting, and evolving them.


### **Looking Ahead: Long-term Onchain Governance Architecture**

The Optimism Foundation [published a post](https://gov.optimism.io/t/looking-ahead-long-term-onchain-governance-architecture/9014) to share some updates and their vision for the future of onchain governance within the Optimism ecosystem. With Agora’s proposal to move the treasury execution onchain (see above), there’s the question of how proposals will work.

While the ‘industry standard’ is permissionless proposals, where a user with X voting power can submit a proposal directly, Optimism currently has permissioned proposals, where only the Foundation can submit proposals to be voted on. That is subject to change in the future, but instead of making a direct change, the Foundation will go for a more granular approach, as outlined in the post.

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

There are several discussions around the (further) decentralization of Optimism, and we’d be interested in discussing them with other delegates and interested parties.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss all of the above and more during our [Optimism Office Hours](meet.google.com/pem-jzrh-gkq) every Tuesday at 3 pm UTC.

## **Arbitrum**

Although it is a surprisingly quiet week in Arbitrum, many things are still happening, especially regarding updates from initiatives or grantees. You should visit the forum for more of that.


## **Active Votes**

**Onchain**

### **Security Council - September 2024 Member Election Phase**

The [Member Election Phase](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/september-2024-member-election-phase/27156) (the final round of voting) for the Arbitrum Security Council’s September 2024 Cohort commenced on October 13th at 15:15 UTC. This phase will run for 21 days, until November 3rd. You can [cast your vote here](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/council/security-council/election/2/round-2).

Vote decay has already been activated since October 20th at ~15:15 UTC and will continue linearly until November 3rd. If you haven’t cast your vote already, it’s highly recommended that you do so soon to avoid losing more voting power.


### **[RFC] Arbitrum DAO Delegate Code of Conduct + Formalizing the DAO’s Operations**

Entropy [posted an RFC](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-arbitrum-dao-delegate-code-of-conduct-formalizing-the-daos-operations/27188) that seeks to introduce a delegate code of conduct for Arbitrum DAO alongside additional improvements to the DAO’s operational standards. If approved, the Code of Conduct and operational updates will take effect on Monday, November 11th, followed by a ~6.5-month trial period ending on May 30th before being considered for permanent inclusion in the Arbitrum Constitution.


* The proposed Code of Conduct covers areas such as:
* Values Alignment
* Good Faith and Best Interest
* Due Care and Attention
* Civility and Professionalism
* Responsibility
* Conflicts of Interest and their Resolution
* Delegate Incentive Program
* DAO-Elected Positions

We encourage you to read the full proposal to better comprehend the full scope of what’s being proposed and the implications of the Code of Conduct for delegates. Some operational improvements are also being proposed, including the voting schedule that the DAO has previously ratified, election standards, the introduction of shielded voting, and delegating tokens to the Arbitrum exclude address.

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

We’re interested in discussing the proposals currently being voted on with other delegates and relevant stakeholders so we can better inform our view. 

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss all of the above and more during our [Arbitrum Office Hours](meet.google.com/jkj-nnop-arc) every Thursday at 3 pm UTC.

## **Uniswap**

Uniswap has also been quiet over the last week, with the launch of Unichain taking all the attention.


## **Active Votes**

**Onchain**

[[Updated] Forse Analytics for Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/uniswap/proposal/72) – ends on October 26 at 15:10 UTC


### **Launch of Unichain**

Although not directly related to the DAO, we couldn’t ignore[ the announcement of the launch of Unichain](https://x.com/Uniswap/status/1844363396382408774), a new L2 designed for DeFi. To learn more about Unichain, we encourage you to read [the full blog post](https://blog.uniswap.org/introducing-unichain) by Uniswap Labs.


### **[RFC] Principles for Uniswap DAO**

Kfx [submitted an RFC](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-principles-for-uniswap-dao/24724) introducing a potential set of principles (the Principles) for the Uniswap DAO. The main goal of the RFC is to document and formalize the current shared understanding of the DAO's guidelines, checks, and aspirational goals and its delegates.

The principles outlined in the document include:



* Process
* Representation
* Accountability
* Onchain Focus
* Disclosure
* Decentralization
* Security
* Legibility

As of now, the Principles are presented as non-constitutional and non-binding. In other words, they do not alter Uniswap’s governance process, and delegates are free to choose whether to follow them based on their own judgment. If the overall feedback is positive, the Principles will proceed to a Snapshot vote to ratify them.

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

We’re seeing a trend in DAOs setting some sort of code of conduct or shared principles for delegates to follow. We’re interested in discussing this with other Uniswap delegates and stakeholders to get their views on the topic.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss all the above and more during our [Uniswap Office Hours](http://meet.google.com/twm-jafw-esn) every Friday at 3 pm UTC.

## **Polygon**


### **[RFC] PIP-48: Path-Based Storage Scheme**

Jerry from PolygonLabs - PoS [submitted an RFC](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-48-path-based-storage-scheme/19917) that introduces a Path-Based Storage Model for the Polygon PoS chain, aimed at improving trie access speed, reducing data redundancy and disk I/O. This model changes the way trie nodes are persisted on disk and manages multiple versions of the state, addressing challenges with the current storage mechanism.


### **Impact Report for Thrive Polygon Season 1**

Katharina from Thrive [published an impact report](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/impact-report-for-thrive-polygon-season-1/19908) from Thrive Polygon Season 1. Thrive Protocol was chosen as the first grants allocator by Polygon. Their role in Season 1 was to quickly and efficiently deploy 800,000 MATIC to boost consumer crypto in Polygon.

Out of 255 applicants, Thrive funded 23 projects, with 16 of them having fully completed their milestones. For a more detailed breakdown, we encourage you to read the full report.

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

## **Everclear**

Security Council elections concluded, and the new Security Council is being transitioned. In the meantime, Creed has revived its Security Task Force proposal.


### **[RFC] Everclear Security Task Force**

Goncalo from Creed DAO [updated their original RFC](https://forum.connext.network/t/rfc-everclear-security-task-force/1259/4), which proposes that they (Creed) take on the role of Security Partnership for Everclear Systems & Operations. This partnership will focus on maintaining and enhancing the security of the Everclear network by conducting thorough security reviews, overseeing smart contract upgrades, and performing comprehensive security assessments.

The proposal suggests an annual term in exchange for $384,000 paid in $NEXT, with 50% vested over 12 months and the remaining 50% paid out based on pre-agreed deliverables and milestones. 

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

We’re trying to understand whether there’s a need for a Security Task Force now that the Security Council has been renewed. We’d like to discuss with other delegates and Everclear stakeholders better to understand the needs and reasoning behind the proposal.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss all the above and more during our [Everclear Office Hours](http://meet.google.com/twm-jafw-esn) every Friday at 3 pm UTC.

## **Lisk**

The first ever (non-test) proposal for Lisk is up on Tally!


## **Active Votes**

**Onchain**

### **Proposal Overview**

Mona [has published an overview](https://forum.lisk.com/t/proposal-overview/57) of proposals discussed in Lisk’s DAO recently.

**Discuss with L2BEAT:**

We’re interested in discussing with other Lisk delegates or stakeholders and learning more about the areas in which we could be involved. Although we do not have dedicated Office Hours for Lisk yet, we encourage you to [message us](https://t.me/sinkas5), and we’ll find time to chat.


## **ZkSync**

### **[RFC] ZKsync Ignite Program (the "Ignite Program")**

Baptist [submitted a TPP](https://forum.zknation.io/t/draft-tpp-zksync-ignite-program-the-ignite-program/168) that seeks to allocate 325,000,000 ZK tokens over nine months to deploy a program designed to establish a DeFi liquidity hub on ZKsync Era. The program aims to increase DeFi TVL and improve liquidity across all interoperable ZK Chains.

The proposal is rather comprehensive, and summarizing it in the context of governance review wouldn’t be feasible. Instead, we encourage you to read the full post to understand the details fully.


### **[RFC] Protocol Defense**

Koloz published a ZIP that proposes deploying quality-of-life improvements to ZKsync Era. The proposed improvements include:



* Custom errors to replace string-based reverts for improved gas usage and revert insights
* Stricter solhint rules for better code quality and consistency
* Introduction of floating compiler version for interfaces and libraries to enhance ecosystem compatibility
* Incorporation of various gas optimizations to improve overall efficiency
* Charge for pubdata in L2 -> L1 logs
* The ability for chains to charge more to cover the overhead of interacting with L1 


### **[RFC] Implementation of Governance Cycles in ZKsync**

Curia [submitted an RFC](https://forum.zknation.io/t/rfc-implementation-of-governance-cycles-in-zksync/156) that suggests implementing a structured Governance Cycle for ZKsync, dividing governance activities into clear, recurring phases. The cycle will allow for the systematic review and decision-making on proposals, fostering a transparent and predictable governance process.

**Discuss with L2BEAT:**

Although relatively new, ZKsync’s DAO is seeing some pretty hasty and interesting developments that we’re keen to discuss with other delegates and stakeholders. Although we do not have a dedicated Office Hours call yet, feel free to [shoot us a message](https://t.me/sinkas5), and we’ll find time to chat.
