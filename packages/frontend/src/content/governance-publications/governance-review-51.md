### **Recommendation to include World Verified Users in the evaluation algorithms for Onchain Builders**

Ccerv1 has [shared a post](https://gov.optimism.io/t/recommendation-to-include-world-verified-users-in-the-evaluation-algorithms-for-onchain-builders/9907) recommending that World‑verified addresses be folded into Optimism’s Retro Funding S7 “Goldilocks” scoring model for On‑chain Builders, giving them the same weight as Farcaster‑linked wallets in the Monthly Active User (MAU) metric. Leveraging on‑chain logs from World’s address‑book contracts, the team reran March data for 188 projects under four simulations; a 50/50 split between Farcaster and World Verified Users (Sim 2) produced the gentlest re‑allocation—21 projects would gain ≥ 1000 OP while 27 would lose that much—so ccerv1 proposes adopting that mix for the April snapshot now due on 12 May. The change is meant to recognise builders who attract sybil‑resistant World Mini‑App traffic without upending the reward table. Complete datasets and replication scripts sit in the Retro‑Funding repo, and comments are invited before finalizing the next measurement run.


### **govNERDs Season 7: Update Thread**

Sov [has published](https://gov.optimism.io/t/govnerds-season-7-update-thread/9755/12?u=manugotsuka) the govNERDs bi‑weekly update, recapping governance activity from 22 April to 2 May. Voting Cycle #36 and the Citizens‑House Budget‑Board vote both wrapped on 30 April, while the Isthmus/Blob‑pre‑image maintenance upgrade passed its optimistic‑approval window; attention now shifts to Cycle #37 (review through 15 May) and the Isthmus hard‑fork go‑live since 9 May. The note lists recent comms work (voting announcements, Citizens‑House messaging, the 22 April Joint‑House call, weekly DAO meeting, and April 29 office hours), outlines feedback fed into OP Atlas, and previews a draft Season 8 charter plus a revamped delegate‑engagement plan that moves from passive open calls to proactive, scheduled outreach.

### **Stablecoin + Micro-Escrow for Volatile Economies**

EmmanuelO has opened a [Technical‑Discussion thread](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stablecoin-micro-escrow-for-volatile-economies/29196/1) pitching a USD‑backed “ARB stablecoin” plus a smart‑contract micro‑escrow layer to serve traders and freelancers in high‑inflation markets like Nigeria and Argentina.

The idea is to issue a 1‑for‑1 dollar‑pegged asset on Arbitrum, fully collateralised with fiat reserves at a regulated custodian, then wrap it in escrow contracts that lock funds until both sides confirm delivery, or route disputes through on‑chain arbitration. For cross‑border SMEs, the stablecoin promises a hedge against 40‑50 % annual currency slides and slashes remittance fees from 5‑10 % to Arbitrum’s sub‑$0.10 gas; for informal local merchants, the micro‑escrow aims to cut fraud in cash‑heavy street trade. A three‑phase roadmap starts with a compliance pilot in Argentina/Nigeria (0‑2 months), rolls out a web/mobile MVP with instant fiat off‑ramps (3‑5 months), then expands to Turkey, Lebanon, and Venezuela while exposing an API to gig‑economy platforms. Before hardening the spec, EmmanuelO solicits feedback on the best fiat on/off‑ramp models, potential Arbitrum partners, and dispute‑resolution design.


### **Entropy Advisors Monthly Update: April 2025**

Entropy [has published](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/entropy-advisors-monthly-update-april-2025/29167/1) its April operations update, detailing progress across every central mandate it stewards for the Arbitrum DAO—from Stylus Sprint milestone reviews and OpCo oversight to treasury execution, data dashboards, and the new Watchdog whistle‑blowing portal now queued for a Tally vote. The Stable Treasury Endowment Program’s STEP 2 allocations (WisdomTree WTGXX 30 %, Spiko USTBL 35 %, Franklin BENJI 35 %) have passed Snapshot; the Treasury‑Management v1.2 stable‑coin tranche is entering execution while the ARB‑only track heads back to RFP; the OpCo Oversight & Transparency Committee has its first three members seated; and DRIP—the 80M ARB, season‑based DeFi Renaissance incentive plan—has had its Snapshot delayed to absorb community feedback. Entropy’s data arm shipped five new dashboards (delegate stats, MEV arbitrage, Timeboost revenue, Security‑Council elections, and liquidation MEV) and will now pivot to a complete Timeboost impact study. May goals include launching the Watchdog leak site, posting a revamped events‑budget proposal, unifying TMC/GMC/STEP under a single treasury council, and getting the DRIP vote to Snapshot before month‑end, while also drafting Entropy’s renewal pitch for post‑July engagement.


### **STEP Report - April 2025**

Steakhouse [has posted](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/step-report-april-2025/29192) the April status report for Arbitrum’s STEP, bundling a month‑end PDF statement with a live Dune dashboard that tracks assets, yields, and historical interest.

As of 30 April the endowment’s AUM breakdown shows aggregate balances of roughly $131 million across USDC, USDT, DAI, T‑Bills, and tokenised money‑market funds; the update tables life‑to‑date returns for every instrument and plots them against the three‑month Treasury benchmark, highlighting that most holdings continue to outperform the rolling T‑bill average. The report also notes that STEP’s second diversification round has finished its review: the committee’s preferred allocations—30 % WisdomTree WTGXX, 35 % Spiko USTBL, and 35 % Franklin BENJI—were ratified in a Snapshot vote earlier this week and will be executed over coming weeks. Links to the complete statement, yield history, and the Dune analytics dashboard are provided in the post for delegates who want to drill into the data.

### **[RFC] Enable 0.05% Protocol Fee on All Uniswap v3 Pools for One-Month Experiment**

Neozaru [has posted](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-enable-0-05-protocol-fee-on-all-uniswap-v3-pools-for-one-month-experiment/25589) an RFC asking the DAO to flip Uniswap v3’s long‑dormant “fee‑switch” to 0.05 % on every v3 pool across every chain for a strictly‑limited 30‑day trial. The experiment would start at a governance‑approved block/time, auto‑revert to zero after one month, and rely on v3’s built‑in fee parameter, so no contract upgrades are required. During the window, analytics teams would track protocol‑fee revenue, trading volume, liquidity depth, LP migration, and slippage to give the DAO complex data on protocol fees' economic and behavioural impact. A 0.05% take is pitched as low enough to deter mass LP flight yet high enough to generate meaningful treasury income and insight; narrower pilots or permanent activation were dismissed as either biased or premature. If feedback is favourable, the flow moves to Snapshot temp‑ and consensus checks, and then an on‑chain vote to schedule the switch‑on, with precise monitoring and public reporting throughout the test.


### **UAC Season 4 Application**

PGov [has opened](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uac-season-4-application/25580) the Season 4 application thread for the Uniswap Accountability Committee (UAC), kicking off the search for two new members now that the on‑chain renewal vote has passed. The post reiterates that the committee will expand to 5 people through year‑end 2025, with a 40‑hour‑per‑month budget cap. It lays out clear ground rules: candidates must apply as individuals, submit the standard template by 21 May 23:59 UTC, and observe the “max‑matching” voting fair‑play rule that limits self‑votes to 50% (mirrored to at least one other nominee). All qualified applicants will advance to a five‑day Snapshot, where the top two vote‑getters join the multisig for S4.


### **[RFC] Aave’s CDP for Uniswap V4 Positions**

AaveLabs [has posted](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-aave-s-cdp-for-uniswap-v4-positions/25568) an RFC with the idea of letting LPs mint GHO—or, once Aave V4 launches, borrow other stable or volatile assets—against their V4 liquidity, while piping half of all GHO‑borrow revenue straight into the Uniswap protocol‑fee collector. The contract suite is 90 % complete after a year of R&D (first on V3, now ported to V4) and pairs a collateral‑valuation/ liquidation engine with Aave’s risk modules and oracles; a BorrowableAssetManager would draw GHO liquidity via a new facilitator bucket (and later plug into the Aave V4 hub for deeper markets). AaveLabs seeks $3.3 million in UNI over 18 months for final dev work, audits, UI and multi‑chain rollout, plus 2.8 million UNI in incentives and alignment: 550k UNI up‑front for Aave DAO governance participation/risk cover; 550k UNI for immediate GHO liquidity mining on V4; and 300k‑UNI tranches released as outstanding loans hit $50M, $100M, $300M and $500M. Until those milestones—or three years—Uniswap and Aave would split GHO interest 50/50; thereafter, the share shifts to 20 % Uniswap / 80 % Aave. Based on capturing half the $2B “usable TVL” now sitting in V3‑backed Aave markets, AaveLabs projects up to $22.6 million in revenue for the Uniswap DAO. If the community endorses the plan, a Snapshot and on‑chain vote will follow, and AaveLabs will commit to shipping an Ethereum‑mainnet MVP within six months of approval.

## **Polygon**


### **PIP-65: Economic Model for VEBloP Architecture**

Jerry Chen [has followed](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-65-economic-model-for-veblop-architecture/20933) up on April’s VEBloP scaling blueprint (PIP‑64) with a draft revenue scheme that decides who earns what once Polygon PoS moves to a single elected producer per span. Under the plan, every transaction fee (and any MEV the chain captures) would first flow into a smart‑contract “fee pool.” Twenty percent of that pot is carved out as a commission for block producers, split 60 %/40 % between an equal share and a share proportionate to each producer’s block count; the remaining 80 % is redistributed to *all* validators, but weighted by stake *and* a live performance score that reflects how reliably they vote on milestones. The example math shows a sole producer with 1 M POL stake pocketing 405 POL of a 1200‑POL checkpoint, while two non‑producing validators on 2 M/3 M POL stakes collect 298 POL and 497 POL, respectively. Base parameters (20 % commission, 60/40 split) could be tuned later by governance, and the model explicitly leaves existing Heimdall/L1 checkpoint staking rewards untouched. New contracts will be required to pool and disburse fees, and Bor/Heimdall clients must forward fee flow and track validator votes; Chen flags future work on automated MEV‑abuse triggers but says, for now, rogue producers could be rotated out through social consensus.


### **Polygon Staking Report. April 2025 (By Validator.Info)**

ValidatorInfo [has published](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/polygon-staking-report-april-2025-by-validator-info/20929) its monthly dashboard of Polygon‑PoS validator metrics, flagging a reshuffle at the top of the stake league table: Twinstake now edges Upbit Staking by a whisker (308.6 M vs 307.6 M POL) while Luganodes, Binance Node, and Coinbase round out the five‑largest bonders. Everstake keeps its crown for delegate count (4,206 wallets), and Figment leads the month‑on‑month stake‑growth chart after adding 49 M POL. Google Cloud tops the net‑new‑delegator column (+107), and five operators—Twinstake, Upbit Staking, Luganodes, Binance Node, and Coinbase—logged a perfect 100 % checkpoint record. Heimdall and Bor block‑signing ‘clean sheets’ went to Staking4all, CheckBit, PolygonGO, StakeCraft, kytzu (Heimdall), Supermoon, SelfLiquidity, Prometheus Pool, The Abyss, Blue Ocean (Bor). ValidatorInfo’s full PDF, Dune dashboard, and period‑over‑period charts are available on its portal for deeper drill‑downs.

## **Starknet**


### **Add a “Highest Points Achieved” Column to the Wolf Pack Leaderboard**

Immanuel Olivia [has floated](https://community.starknet.io/t/add-a-highest-points-achieved-column-to-the-wolf-pack-leaderboard/115541) a light‑touch UX tweak for StarkNet’s community‑engagement board: alongside the existing identifier, WPL ID, monthly‑points, cumulative‑points, and tier columns, she suggests displaying each wolf’s single‑month personal best. The extra field, she argues, would spotlight peak performances, give veterans a fresh benchmark to beat, and add a dash of friendly competition without altering the current ranking logic. Feedback from the pack is invited before the idea is shipped to the team.

### **Standing Delegate Call May 13 - Thread**

TheShelb [has opened](https://forum.zknation.io/t/standing-delegate-call-may-13-thread/672) the usual thread for ZKsync’s next Standing Delegate Call, set for Tuesday, 13 May. Delegates are asked to post and “like” on discussion topics to shape the agenda; items with the most support will get priority. A draft running order will be added to the post on the day of the meeting. The tentative list already includes quick proposal updates, a review of Token‑Program multisig policy, and a presentation from @rafa on the new capped‑minter mods. Calendar links for the recurring Delegate Calls are provided for easy subscription.


### **Matter Labs | Q1 2025 Deliverables Report**

Matter Labs [has posted](https://forum.zknation.io/t/matter-labs-q1-2025-deliverables-report/674) a quarterly report showing the core ZKsync team firing on all fronts. On performance, Boojum 1.0 optimisation cut prover start‑up costs 40 %, while the in‑development Boojum 2.0 RISC‑V stack reached a lab milestone that slices per‑tx cost targets to $0.0001 and proves 10× faster than rival systems; an EVM‑precompile upgrade audited for v28 slashed verifier gas by ~94 %. Cost‑sharing infrastructure is live as ZK Gateway batches proofs from Era and partner chains, and Bridgehub now provides a single native bridge for Elastic‑Network liquidity. Execution delay on Era fell from 21 h to 3 h, SGX‑backed two‑factor controls landed for privileged ops, and the ChonkyBFT protocol has begun running with multiple validators—the first step toward sequencer decentralisation.

Developer UX likewise improved: full byte‑code equivalence via an EVM interpreter shipped in v27; Foundry‑zksync 0.0.14 adds zkEVM workflows; Smart Sign‑On cleared audit for passkey log‑ins; and explorer upgrades allow cross‑verification with Etherscan and auto‑verify byte‑code variants. Matter Labs also helped launch or advance nine partner ZK Chains (Lens, zkCandy, WonderFi, Abstract, and others). They demonstrated bridge‑free cross‑chain calls between two chains at ETHDenver, underscoring the Elastic Network’s bid for native interoperability.

### **Governance Contribution Recognition**

Eugene has [created a proposal](https://forum.scroll.io/t/governance-contribution-recognition/673) to compensate the people who have kept Scroll DAO ticking since the token launch. The draft framework would run a one‑time “six‑month retro” covering October 2024 through 15 April 2025, then hand over to a more systematic model. Under the proposed maths any wallet that cast at least one on‑chain vote receives a modest baseline (≈ $120 in SCR per ballot); higher‑touch work—forum posts, community‑call attendance, proposal shepherding or helping Negation‑Game researchers—earns stacked bonuses that top out a little above $10 k (at $0.20 per SCR). The spreadsheet shared in the post shows how the formula plays out for current delegates and invites everyone to tweak the numbers, suggest extra qualifying activities, or comment on payout cadence ahead of a formal vote targeted for the June cycle. Eugene stresses that this is just a first pass: as Scroll’s organisational design firms up, the DAO will likely move to a standing, data‑driven rewards engine, but the retro is meant to acknowledge early sweat equity without further delay. Before drafting the final proposal, feedback on eligibility thresholds, weighting, and frequency is welcome.


### **Nigeria Local Node - Regional Evaluation**

Abidemi Adenle [has opened](https://forum.scroll.io/t/nigeria-local-node-regional-evaluation/698/1) a Regional Evaluation thread that seeks green light from the Scroll Foundation and the DAO to stand up a Local Node in Nigeria. Citing a 42 million‑strong, tech‑savvy youth cohort, some $400 million in annual peer‑to‑peer crypto turnover, and roughly 7,500 active blockchain devs, the post paints Nigeria as “not just Africa’s most crypto‑native country but a market where Web3 is already used out of necessity.” The proposal lists challenges (patchy internet, lingering education gaps, limited institutional rails) yet maps out a dense local scene: over 80 Web3 start‑ups raising $130 M; DeFi plays like Xend Finance and Canza; infra projects such as Wicrypt’s DePIN hotspots; on‑ramp heavyweights Yellow Card and Chipper Cash; and education hubs Web3Bridge and Web3 Afrika. A joint leadership team—Ayodeji Awosika (Web3Bridge) and Idris Olubi (Web3 Afrika), with Abidemi as coordinator—would pilot a “start‑small, learn‑fast” programme: campus activations across universities, Scroll‑focused workshops, feedback loops with builders and users, and micro‑grants for early zk‑Chain experiments. Support requested from Scroll includes a liaison on DevRel, operating funds for events and stipends, SDK access, and marketing amplification.
