## **Optimism**


### **Season 8: Security Council Elections - Cohort A and Lead**

The Optimism Foundation [has released](https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-8-security-council-elections-cohort-a-and-lead/10303) a post announcing the opening of the Season 8 Security Council elections for Cohort A and the Council Lead, outlining the timelines, roles, and eligibility requirements. Self-nominations are submitted on OP Atlas from Sept 29 to Oct 10 at 19:00 GMT. Each candidate must secure 8 approvals from Top-100 delegates by Oct 15 at 19:00 GMT, and approval voting runs Oct 16–22; successful candidates begin 12-month terms on Feb 9, 2026, after passing Foundation screening (KYC/AML and agreement signing). Members are key holders responsible for secure key management, enacting governance-approved upgrades, coordinating during emergencies, and proving liveness; stipends in OP follow an operating budget proposed by the Council Lead. The Lead is not a key holder and instead manages timelines, meetings, onboarding, compliance with procedures, and communications around upgrades. Eligibility emphasizes reputation, baseline OP Stack and key-management competency, alignment and availability, plus diversity safeguards by country and organization; individuals or entities operating for at least a year may apply. Members can be removed via Representative Removal or, in defined emergencies, by the Security Council or the Foundation, with replacements elected in the next available cycle.


### **Cycle 42 Results – Season 8 Audit Grants**

M4rio.eth [created](https://gov.optimism.io/t/cycle-42-results-season-8-audit-grants/10315) a post that shares Cycle 42 results for Season 8 Audit Grants, approving two applications—Own Protocol for 48,250 OP and TrueMarkets for 62,500 OP—placing three on hold for possible later approval (Solo Chain for 46,800 OP, VII Finance for 78,471 OP, and Esusu for 49,350 OP), and declining seven others due to cost, funding mix, or alignment concerns. This cycle saw 893,377 OP requested and 110,750 OP approved, leaving 347,676.4 OP in the Season 8 Audit Grants budget (from an initial 581,726.40 OP, with 458,426.40 OP remaining after the prior cycle). The update notes continued calibration on cadence and metrics, light AI-assisted screening, and a stronger emphasis on realistic benchmarks and meaningful cost-sharing. Approved projects proceed to funding, while the three on hold may be revisited in upcoming cycles.

## **Arbitrum**


### **AIP: DVP Quorum**

The Arbitrum Foundation [created](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/constitutional-aip-dvp-quorum/30053) a proposal that upgrades the DAO’s voting contracts to base quorum on Delegated Voting Power rather than the vote-eligible supply, addressing rising fixed-supply quorums that grow ~36M ARB per year for non-constitutionals and ~54M ARB for constitutionals and risk stalling governance; the new rule would set quorum to the greater of a fixed floor and α times total DVP (with distinct α and baselines for each proposal type), requires upgrading the ARB token to track total DVP and the governor to read it, will be developed and tested by Offchain Labs (a PoC is linked), and will go to a Snapshot temperature check Oct 9–16 with exact parameter values to be finalized in a later Snapshot ahead of the on-chain vote.


### **Arbitrum Double Dip (ADD)**

Paulofonseca [created](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-double-dip-add/30054) a proposal that outlines “Arbitrum Double Dip,” a streamlined delegate incentive program paying two monthly rewards: First Dip for voting participation and Second Dip for peer-scored contributions, aimed at predictable, objective, and low-overhead payouts. Rewards are issued only if the month’s votes collectively clear a quorum; each enrolled delegate must vote in 100% of off-chain and 100% of on-chain proposals to qualify. First Dip distributes a fixed example pool of 30k ARB pro-rata by each qualifier’s average cast voting power, with a ≥500k ARB average VP threshold. Second Dip distributes a 70k ARB pool based on a shielded, token-weighted contribution vote where delegates report up to five impactful actions; self-votes invalidate eligibility, and only those receiving at least 10% of the top recipient’s support share the pool, with a ≥50k ARB average VP threshold. The design replaces subjective scoring with formulaic rules, targets zero admin burden beyond Foundation/OpCo payout processing, and runs on a tight cadence: reports by the 1st–5th, contribution vote 5th–12th, payouts 12th–15th. Suspension or bans can be enacted by the Foundation/OpCo with appeal via an off-chain vote exceeding 3% of votable ARB; rule or parameter changes require the same threshold and are never retroactive. A temp check Oct 9–16 precedes an on-chain vote Oct 23–Nov 6, aiming to launch in November 2025, with illustrative parameters implying ~1.2M ARB per year in rewards at a $0.50 ARB price.


### **October 2025 Security Council Elections – Mandatory Voting for DIP Incentives**

SEEDGov [created](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/october-2025-security-council-elections-mandatory-voting-for-dip-incentives/30037) a post that announces Security Council member elections as a mandatory action for October DIP eligibility, noting the 21-day voting window runs Oct 13 to Nov 3 and will be scored in October since most of the period falls this month; participation is tracked in a dedicated Karma module (not the standard on-chain participation metric), and late voting carries a linear penalty after day seven—0.3572 TP per day up to a 5-point max by day twenty-one—so delegates should vote early to avoid deductions and keep full DIP rewards.


### **Entropy Advisors Data Dashboards Catalog**

Entropy [created](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/entropy-advisors-data-dashboards-catalog/30041) a post that announces a living catalog of their Dune analytics, centralizing links to dashboards for Arbitrum DAO (treasury, management, proposals, financials, delegates, Security Council), DRIP Season 1 trackers (lending, ETH, USD), Arbitrum One network and MEV views (Timeboost, atomic arbs, liquidations), case studies and upgrade trackers, plus protocol pages for Aave, Ethena (USDe, sUSDe, USDtb, fee switch), Euler, Fluid (DEX and lending), Morpho, Uniswap v4 adoption on Arbitrum, Franklin Templeton BENJI, and a library of reusable queries (Chain GDP, DEX volume, TVL, network stats); the thread will be updated periodically and points readers to the Entropy Advisors Data Catalog on Dune for direct access.

## **Uniswap**


### **Uniswap Community Proposal Factory**

GFX Labs created a post [outlining](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-community-proposal-factory/25838) a “Community Proposal Factory” for Uniswap — a Governor Bravo–compatible subDAO that allows smaller UNI holders to pool votes and advance executable proposals after a lower-threshold pre-vote. In the sample config, anyone with 100 UNI can propose inside the CPF proposals that reach a 10M UNI quorum get pushed to Governor Bravo, and the CPF would use a 20M UNI treasury delegation to propose and vote. The ask is 20M UNI delegated, plus $75k in UNI for build/testing, aiming to reduce proposal friction, filter spam, and broaden participation without compromising security.

## **Polygon**


### **Erigon Update and future plans**

Parvez03 from Polygon Labs’ Validator Support team [created a post](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/erigon-update-and-future-plans/21316) that announces Polygon Labs is now maintaining the Erigon client for Polygon PoS, with future PRs, issues, and releases moving to the 0xPolygon/erigon GitHub repo; the team also previewed PBSS archive mode for the Bor client to sharply cut archive-node disk usage, which is expected to replace most Erigon archive deployments once released.


### **Revision of POL Tokenomics – Elimination of 2% Inflation and Introduction of Treasury Buyback/Burn Policy**

VentureFounder [created a post](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/proposal-revision-of-pol-tokenomics-elimination-of-2-inflation-and-introduction-of-treasury-buyback-burn-policy/21323) that proposes overhauling POL tokenomics by scrapping the 2% annual inflation and replacing it with a treasury-funded buyback or burn policy; the draft suggests either moving to 0% inflation at the next upgrade or tapering by 0.5% per quarter to zero, dedicating at least 20% of quarterly net inflows to on-chain buybacks/burns, halting discretionary treasury sales, and publishing quarterly tokenomics reports with a live dashboard; the rationale cites prolonged underperformance and argues validator rewards can be covered by fees/treasury rather than emissions, with an implementation path of community debate in Q4 2025, an on-chain vote in Q1 2026, a 0% inflation switch in Q2 2026, and buyback/burn operations beginning Q3 2026, all without consensus-layer changes but with short-term validator top-ups as needed.


### **PIP-73: Rio Hardfork**

H_Rook (PolygonLabs Governance) [created a post](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-73-rio-hardfork/21268) summarizing the finalization of PIP-73 Rio Hardfork for Polygon PoS, setting the activation at block 26,201,856 on Amoy and 77,414,656 on Mainnet. This update bundles PIP-64 (Validator-Elected Block Producer) and PIP-72 (Witness-Based Stateless Verification) into a Core upgrade, marked as Final, with no additional security considerations noted.

## **Starknet**


### **SNIP 34 - more efficient CASM hashes**

Ohad-StarkWare created a post that [outlines](https://community.starknet.io/t/snip-34-more-efficient-casm-hashes/115979) SNIP-34 to speed up Starknet by switching CASM hash computation from Poseidon to blake2s ahead of the S-Two release, plus batching multiple Cairo opcodes per hash; together they target ~8× fewer proving costs for “opcode validity” checks and shrink this overhead to only a few percent of block capacity. Declare txs would compute compiled_class_hash with a new V2 Blake2s scheme, and existing classes would migrate lazily the first time their code is executed, with migrations reflected in state updates via a new migrated_compiled_classes field. Backward-compatibility risks are limited to SDKs updating declare V3 hashing and rare “too-large” txs during on-the-fly migrations, both mitigated by dual-hash SDK support and a safe manual-migration pattern; no security concerns are noted.

### **ESC Elections 2025 - Application thread**

SEEDGov [created a post](https://forum.connext.network/t/esc-elections-2025-application-thread/1399) that opens applications for the 2025 Everclear Security Council and provides a required template for candidates. The 14-day window starts with the posting (Sept 29). It covers two roles: eight Regular Members and one Security Council Lead. The guardrails include a maximum of two representatives per organization, upfront COI disclosure, verifiable technical expertise (prior council experience is preferred), and KYC/KYB, as well as legal agreements post-election. Lead applicants must include a budget and expand on the responsibilities outlined in the Security Council Upgrade RFC. The template asks for name, socials, wallet/ENS, role (if Lead), budget, a detailed intro and skillset, why you’re a fit, your vision for the DAO, and a signed disclaimer acknowledging the RFC requirements.

## **Lisk**


### **Establish the Lisk DAO Fund and cover 2026 budget**

SuperchainEco [has created a proposal](https://forum.lisk.com/t/establish-the-lisk-dao-fund-and-cover-2026-budget/591) that establishes a dedicated Lisk DAO Fund for 2026 and requests 3,733,000 LSK to cover its first year, comprising 3,333,000 LSK for early-stage investments and 400,000 LSK for management. This proposal aims to shift seasonal grants into SAFE/SAFT investments, providing upside to the treasury. The fund targets MVP-stage builders graduating from Lisk-aligned incubators and onchain startups (with emphasis on Africa, LATAM, SEA), writes initial $25–50k checks with follow-ups up to $50k, and is managed by Symphony (Superchain Eco team) under a legal wrapper with DAO oversight and a three-month pause/recall option. Proceeds flow back to the Lisk Treasury in USDT/USDC with a 25% carry on net profits that vest over six years; KPIs include funded project count and survival, ecosystem impact, and returned value.


### **Mid Report | Lisk DAO Season 2**

SuperchainEco [created a post](https://forum.lisk.com/t/mid-report-lisk-dao-season-2/590) that summarizes the Lisk DAO Season 2 progress through September 30, noting a $ 3,925,000 LSK season budget (comprising $ 3,750,000 LSK for growth) guided by a Grants Council and Steering Committee, and aligned with four social and economic intents. The update reports 43 grant applications with 5 approved under Development & Infra (365,000 LSK approved, 183,400 LSK spent, ~735,000 LSK remaining), a full 750,000 LSK committed to incubation and acceleration across AyaHQ Africa, Lisk Spark Indonesia (with AngelHack/1000 Startup Digital), and the Lisk Pioneer Program, and 250,000 LSK allocated to the Ambassador Program as the DAO takes a larger role in community enablement. Ecosystem Incentives are underway, with an approved integration grant for Kyo Finance to kick off Superchain flows to Lisk, targeting over $3M in non-LSK TVL and over $5M in monthly volume. Meanwhile, planning advances for Lisk Surge Season 2 are underway, following the success of Season 1, which drew over $25M in TVL. The team emphasizes value-per-LSK discipline, continuity for returning builders, and measurable outcomes on usage, TVL, and cross-chain activity, and invites feedback as Season 2 runs in parallel with Optimism Season 8 through December 17, 2025.

## **Scroll**


### **Co-Creation Cycle #3 - Final Report**

Zhgnv [created a post](https://forum.scroll.io/t/co-creation-cycle-3-final-report/1254/2) sharing the final report from Co-Creation Cycle 3, highlighting what worked and what didn’t in Scroll’s AI-assisted governance design sprint with Harmonica. Key takeaways include gaining better insight when delegates can answer in their native language, real-time prompt pivots that outperformed traditional surveys, and the need to avoid Monday workshops and holiday conference windows while maintaining consistent domain taxonomies across sessions. The team recommends an async-first flow with Harmonica for divergence, followed by mid-week workshops for convergence, and optional Pol. is for gathering wider sentiment, along with UX tweaks, quality metrics, and thoughtful incentives to increase completion and response depth. The report frames CCCs as idea generators rather than finish lines and positions CCC4 to run a tighter four-week cycle with earlier prep, clearer scoping, and closer integration from insights to proposal drafting.
