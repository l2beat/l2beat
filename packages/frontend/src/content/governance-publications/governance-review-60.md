## **Optimism**


### **Anticapture Commission Dissolution Proposal**

SEEDGov has created a [proposal](https://gov.optimism.io/t/anticapture-commission-dissolution-proposal/10101) to wind down the Anticapture Commission after three experimental Seasons. The post argues that no Token-House capture attempts surfaced, advocacy doesn’t require the 10M OP delegation, and Season 8’s revamped governance lessens the need for an intermediary. The Foundation confirms it will drop retro rewards and delegation either way. To reach Special Voting Cycle #39c, the thread needs four Top-100 delegate approvals by 23 July 19:00 UTC—otherwise, the ACC quietly sunsets.

### **Updating the Code of Conduct & DAO’s Procedures**

Entropy has created a [proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/updating-the-code-of-conduct-daos-procedures/29594/1) to revamp last year’s trial Code of Conduct, including procedural tweaks, and to run a second pilot from 24 Jul 2025 to 31 Jan 2026. Key edits include a streamlined Code for future constitutional inclusion, the scrapping of the “Responsible Voting” rule now that vote-buying tools exist, default playbooks for replacing DAO-elected members and winding down initiatives, an extended use of shielded Snapshot elections, and a Dec 18–Jan 5 holiday freeze.

### **Arbitrum Ecosystem Mapping & Positioning Recommendations**

Castle Labs and DefiLlama Research [have released](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-ecosystem-mapping-positioning-recommendations/29610) a data-dense mapping of DeFi verticals that pinpoints where Arbitrum’s market share lags and which products, protocols, and incentive tracks could unlock the biggest growth. Using chain-to-chain KPIs, GTM teardown, and dual shortlists, the study flags under-weight arenas, plus concrete levers for DAO grants, BD, and liquidity mining.

### **Strategic Renewal for Support of Uniswap v3 Deployments**

GFX Labs [seeks](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/strategic-renewal-for-support-of-uniswap-v3-deployments/25723) a one-year renewal of Oku-hosted v3 pools on Gnosis and Mantle—the two chains that now top Uniswap’s multichain fee and volume charts—at $60k each (total $120k). Linea and Taiko are offered for delegate debate, while Blast and the shuttered Polygon zkEVM would be off-boarded under Oku’s 30-day notice + 30-day wind-down policy. The pitch: trim low-impact deployments, double down where Uniswap is winning, and keep budget free for future frontier chains.

## **Polygon**

### **Council Transparency Report: PIP-26**

Mudit Gupta from Polygon Protocol Council [published](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/council-transparency-report-pip-26/21112/2) the emergency-track details for PIP-26, which trims validator rewards from 1.5% to 1% POL per year to realign with the genesis MATIC schedule ahead of Polygon 2.0. A new “DefaultEmissionManager” has already been deployed; a Safe batch on 7 Jul 2025 will run “upgradeAndCall”, lock the new logic, and set the fresh start-supply timestamp. The move passed with 10 of 13 council signatures and updates “INTEREST_PER_YEAR_LOG2” to log2(1.02), cutting annual inflation without downtime.

## **Starknet**

### **Starknet Foundation: Introducing Polls**

Starknet_rafael [unveils a plan](https://community.starknet.io/t/starknet-foundation-introducing-polls/115620) for quarterly Snapshot-off-chain polls—Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter—plus ad-hoc surveys, to capture delegate sentiment on protocol and product priorities. Polls are non-binding temperature checks, not votes, and follow a four-week cadence of question gathering, marketing pushes, and post-poll discussion on the next delegate call.

### **SNIP 30: v0.14.0**

Leo L. has [created a proposal](https://community.starknet.io/t/snip-30-v0-14-0/115756) that can be Starknet’s first big decentralization jump: v0.14.0 swaps the lone sequencer for three Tendermint nodes rotating blocks and delivering 1-block finality, adds sub-second “pre-confirmations”, launches an EIP-1559-style L2 gas market with a 3 gFRI floor, and cuts max block time to ≈6 s while capping tx cost at 1 B l2-gas. A 15-minute downtime will roll in multi-block proving and the new mempool.


### **SNIP-X: Expose Keccak-f[1600] Permutation Syscall**

Wh173-c47 [created a proposal](https://community.starknet.io/t/snip-x-expose-keccak-f-1600-permutation-syscall/115770) that suggests a one-liner boost to Starknet OS: add a “keccak_f1600_process_block” syscall that surfaces the raw 1600-bit permutation already baked into the VM. Mirroring “sha256_process_block”, the call would let devs build gas-cheap SHAKE/cSHAKE functions and post-quantum schemes like Falcon—no more pricey pure-Cairo work-arounds. The change is fully backward-compatible, trims API bloat, and opens new crypto design space.

### **Lisk DAO Season 2**

SuperchainEco [asked](https://forum.lisk.com/t/lisk-dao-season-2/449) the DAO to start Season 2 immediately and run it through 17 December 2025 on a 4 million LSK budget: 2.3 million new tokens plus the 1.7 million left from Season 1. About 3.75 million LSK would be paid straight to builders and ecosystem programmes (grants, incentives, incubators, ambassadors), while 250k LSK covers DAO operations. The treasury would sit in a Safe that needs three of the six council signers—three from the Grants Council and three from the Steering Committee—to release funds. Progress reports are promised for 30 September and 22 December 2025, and if the proposal fails, the leftover Season 1 funds go back to the DAO.

## **Scroll**


### **Proposal: Feynman Upgrade**

Up Labs is [asking](https://forum.scroll.io/t/proposal-feynman-upgrade/957) the Scroll DAO to schedule Feynman, the first core upgrade since Euclid, for the August 2025 cycle. The patch introduces an EIP-1559-style congestion fee plus size-based roll-up costs, fixes BLOCKHASH, lifts limits on the ecPairing precompile, adopts Pectra’s EIPs 2935 and 7623, and strips out obsolete contract code—together boosting security, EVM parity, and developer UX. Testnet rolls on 29 July, Snapshot voting runs 4–11 August, and, if approved, mainnet flips on 19 August at 08:00 UTC with no funding required.
