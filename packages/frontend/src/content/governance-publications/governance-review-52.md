## **Optimism**

### **Superscan Metrics Overview: Retro Funding Season 7**

0x_rebeca [has created](https://gov.optimism.io/t/superscan-metrics-overview-retro-funding-season-7/9923) a post that turns the spotlight on Superscan. Superscan has quietly matured into a developer-first SaaS layer: its high-throughput APIs now field roughly 170- 215 thousand calls a month (about four to five requests per second) from 36 different protocols, and its verification engine has processed close to 890 thousand smart-contract proofs since launch. Traffic tells a similar story of growing leverage. Direct visits dominate at just over 52 percent, organic search drives another 28 percent, and referral links—helped by 2.5 million backlinks and integrations with wallets, dApps, and L2 monitoring suites—supply the balance. Monthly active users sit near the 100 thousand mark, sessions average three minutes across almost three pages, and bounce rates hover around 42 percent, suggesting that most visitors stick around to dig into code or analytics rather than merely peek at a single hash.

Those numbers feed a broader argument: block explorers should be evaluated inside Retro Funding as public ledgers and productivity infrastructure that compounds ecosystem output. To that end, Rebeca proposes five impact metrics—developer adoption, ecosystem integrations, debugging experience, transparency/security contribution, and user retention—to stand alongside raw usage figures. She notes that Superscan already indexes 19 Superchain networks and streams real-time data for projects like Velodrome, positioning it as a critical backbone for builders and auditors. Comments are open ahead of Season 7 scoring, and the full dataset plus replication scripts sit in the Retro-Funding repository for anyone keen to stress-test the numbers before allocations are finalised.

### **Optimism Fractal Season 6: Expanding Democratic Coordination Across the Superchain**

Optimystics [has opened](https://gov.optimism.io/t/optimism-fractal-season-6-expanding-democratic-coordination-across-the-superchain/9924) the curtain on Season 6 of Optimism Fractal, the weekly “Respect Game” call series that hands out reputation tokens to builders who present their work and rank one another by impact. After sixty on-chain sessions, 75+ participating projects, and a debut at ETHDenver, the format now plugs into ORDAO smart contracts, letting the community execute treasury actions based on the Respect they earn. Season 6 adds a front-end for ORDAO, a rebuilt Fractalgram interface, mobile access, and a Superchain-wide version so contributors from Base, Zora, World, and other L2s can play in the same reputation pool. The team is also syncing with Optimism Town Hall and Eden Fractal, which will pilot ORDAO on Base for 75 long-time members. Sign-ups, docs, videos, and a calendar of events live on optimismfractal.com; newcomers can earn their first Respect by joining the next call and pitching how they’re helping the Collective grow.

### **Optimism Town Hall Season 4: Growing the Superchain Through Collaborative Governance**

Dan Singjoy [has relaunched](https://gov.optimism.io/t/optimism-town-hall-season-4-growing-the-superchain-through-collaborative-governance/9925) Optimism Town Hall for its fourth season. The Town Hall is an open forum where builders, delegates, and newcomers can dissect Superchain news, demo projects, and workshop governance processes. Agenda-setting is itself democratic: participants use the “Cagendas” and “OPTOPICS” mini-games to stake their Respect tokens (earned in Optimism Fractal) or Citizens-House badges on discussion proposals, ensuring each meeting tracks the community’s real priorities.

Season 4 will keep that format while adding fresh educational segments, builder showcases, and deeper dives into the OP Stack, RetroFunding, and emerging L2 networks. Topic voting happens in the dedicated Snapshot space, and recordings, slides, and resources are posted on OptimismTownHall.com and the Eden Creators YouTube channel. Anyone can RSVP via the public calendar; those wanting extra influence can pick up Respect by joining the preceding Fractal sessions. The organisers see the Town Hall, Optimism Fractal, and Eden Fractal on Base as a trilogy of experiments to scale participatory governance across the entire Superchain—one collaborative, reputation-driven conversation at a time.

### **OpCo May 2025 Update**

The OpCo Oversight & Transparency Committee (OAT) [has published](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/opco-may-2025-update/29232) its inaugural monthly report. Since April’s election the team has (i) incorporated the Arbitrum OpCo Foundation in the Cayman Islands and appointed Hash Directors’ Petri Basson as corporate director; (ii) liquidated $2.6 million worth of the ARB allocation to fund the new entity’s bank account, with the balance still being converted; (iii) begun weekly OAT meetings and recruited community stalwart Pedro Breuer as the fourth committee member while interviewing a VC-profile candidate for the fifth seat; and (iv) launched the search for a “Chief Chaos Coordinator” to run day-to-day ops.

During the bylaws review, the OAT found the original OpCo proposal too restrictive, limiting service-provider choice, budget flexibility, token-vesting for staff, and the committee’s election mechanics. In the coming weeks, a revised governance package that widens operational scope and lets OpCo pursue strategic initiatives on the DAO’s behalf will be drafted and posted for delegate approval.


### **Arbitrum Education, Community Growth, and Events Domain 2.0**

Domain allocator SEEDGov [has published](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/reports-thread-arbitrum-education-community-growth-and-events-domain-2-0/27190/11?u=manugotsuka) its third status update on the Education, Community Growth, and Events 2.0 domain, detailing where the $455k envelope approved last autumn now stands. Twenty-eight proposals have been green-lit so far, ranging from regional hack-weeks such as DeFi Mania (now fully delivered) and ETH Uruguay to rolling community tracks like Arbitrum Arabia 2.0, Namaste Arbitrum!, and a seven-stop university tour in Nigeria. Collectively, the projects have 56 of 110 milestones ticked off on Questbook; $178k has been disbursed against completed work, leaving $277k yet to pay once remaining deliverables land. Because the domain safe still holds roughly $592k, a further $315k is technically uncommitted and available for new rounds. A world map included in the report shows an intentionally broad geographic spread: Latin-American, MENA, African and Asian teams now account for most of the roster, while large flagship sponsorships—Merge Madrid ($40 k), an Arbitrum developer track at ETH Developer events, and Builder-focused initiatives on Stylus—anchor the calendar through year-end. SEEDGov invites delegates to review the grants table, flag mapping errors, and consider fresh applications before the following report.


### **Invest in Builders & Ignite ARB Demand with q/acc**

Griff Green [has proposed](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-invest-in-builders-ignite-arb-demand-with-q-acc/29215/1) a plan to bolt the “Quadratic Accelerator” onto Arbitrum’s grants stack. Instead of gifting builders liquid ARB that is quickly sold, q/acc would seed each selected project with $50k of ARB placed in a bonding-curve market (ABCs). 90% of the newly minted tokens go to the team (time-locked), 5% to Arbitrum DAO, and 5 % to q/acc; matching pools funded by the DAO provide secondary-market liquidity after a quadratic-funding sale in which every buyer receives the same price. Mint- and burn-tributes inside the curve generate perpetual revenue for the project while the ARB collateral remains locked, creating structural buy-pressure if the token gains traction.

The pilot asks for 1.05 M ARB (1.3 M with a volatility buffer) to launch 10 projects in Season 1, cover bonding-curve bots, and seed a $250k matching pool whose LP tokens stay protocol-owned. KPIs target a 10× ratio between project market-caps and ARB injected, a 25% net increase in ARB locked versus ARB granted, and at least 500 first-time Arbitrum users. Season-one results on Polygon’s zkEVM are cited: eight teams raised 342k MATIC, drew 1,253 contributors (97 % new to the chain), and now sit at a collective $4.5 M market-cap—about 10× the grant outlay—with 2.15M MATIC permanently locked in curves. If Arbitrum adopts the scheme, contracts will be deployed on Arbitrum One, Camelot integrations will follow, and a second season will be proposed, subject to performance.


### **Register $BORING in the Arbitrum generic-custom gateway.**

Didi has [proposed registering](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/constitutional-register-boring-in-the-arbitrum-generic-custom-gateway/29206) the ERC-20 token $BORING in the chain’s generic-custom gateway so it can move natively between the Ethereum mainnet and Arbitrum. $BORING is the incentive and fee token of Superboring, a market-making and lending protocol that plans to go live on Arbitrum within the next few weeks. On Ethereum, the token is a simple, non-upgradeable contract at 0x0Bc4…9919; on Arbitrum, it has already been deployed by the same address and to the same address, as a SuperToken that supports streaming and other advanced transfer logic. Because the original L1 contract predates Arbitrum’s current bridge requirements and cannot register itself, the DAO must execute the mapping transaction that tells the gateway that those two contracts are the same asset. The proposer notes that the task is routine and carries negligible cost. While not strictly blocking the superboring launch, having a canonical bridge route would make that deployment far more attractive to users and liquidity providers.


### **Arbitrum Governance Analytics April Report**

Curia has [created a post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-governance-analytics-april-report/29205) that outlines the  April 2025 governance analytics brief, which shows Arbitrum DAO slipping into a quieter month. On-chain turnout fell to 59.8% of votable supply (down 2.5 points), and Snapshot engagement edged lower to 53.8 %. Only five proposals closed during the period—three passed (an audit-program budget, elections for the OpCo oversight committee, and the TMC’s stable-coin strategy) while two broader spending plans were rejected, signalling delegates’ preference for tightly scoped, clearly costed initiatives. Participation totals reveal the break: unique on-chain voters collapsed from 6,200 in March to 311 because the April window captured just four days of balloting; off-chain new-voter count was zero for the first time this year. Despite the fatigue, power shuffled behind the scenes. Entropy’s delegation tripled to 25.7 million ARB, MUX, Blockworks, and others logged multi-million delegations, yet L2BEAT and several mid-tier wallets trimmed delegations, and two addresses exited entirely. Active delegates (those voting in at least two-thirds of the votes) dipped to 87, ghost delegates—wallets with voting power but no activity—climbed to 805, and overall votable supply rose 13 % to 363.8 million ARB. The top-50 wallets now control 90 % of influence, underlining the concentration trend even as delegates continue to block large, loosely defined grant requests.


### **Agentic Governance Initiative [AGI]**

Event Horizon [has opened a discussion](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/agentic-governance-initiative-agi/29244?u=manugotsuka) on an Agentic Governance Initiative, arguing that AI-driven delegate agents will soon be indispensable to DAOs and that Arbitrum should lead the field rather than chase it. Over the past eight months the team has shipped a metagovernance layer in which each retail voter can spin up a personalised “consul” bot: the agent scrapes forum threads, tracks sentiment, writes rationales, casts on-chain and Snapshot votes, and feeds its human “emperor” periodic reports that can be overridden at any time. More than two hundred such agents are already live, and early experiments show them debating each other, translating proposals, and suggesting quorum-reduction safeguards.

The post outlines a possible roadmap—richer swarm deliberation, predictive delegate-voting forecasts, bidirectional forum tagging, flexible proportional voting via ScopeLift, a proposal-publishing conduit, and a global chat that would let users and bots brainstorm in real time—but stresses the scope is open for community design. Event Horizon proposes forming an Agentic Governance working group and is willing to operate independently or align as a complete Arbitrum-Aligned Entity, depending on feedback. Before a formal initiative is drafted, commenters are invited to suggest features, guardrails, or entirely new use cases.

## **Uniswap**


### **[RFC] - Deploy Uniswap V3 on Redbelly Network**

Redbelly Network [has created](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-deploy-uniswap-v3-on-redbelly-network/25608/1) an RFC to have its already-deployed Uniswap V3 instance recognised as a canonical deployment under Uniswap governance. Redbelly—a formally verified, EVM-compatible L1 spun out of research at the University of Sydney and CSIRO—targets compliant real-world-asset markets: every wallet is KYC/KYB-verified, gas fees are fixed in USD, and the chain claims 97,500 TPS with sub-second finality. The team argues that these features make Redbelly an ideal venue for tokenised structured products and on-chain registries, opening a new regulated-RWA frontier for Uniswap liquidity. All core V3 contracts and supporting tools like the Universal Router and Wormhole bridge receiver are live at the same addresses as on Ethereum; Oku will provide the front-end, and GFX Labs will handle deployment. No further action is required beyond having the Accountability Committee append the contract set to the v3-deployments.uniswap.eth ENS record, after which control would rest with L1 Uniswap governance.

## **Hop**


### **Delegate Incentive Program Discussion**

Francom [has opened](https://forum.hop.exchange/t/delegate-incentive-program-discussion/1341) a discussion on rebuilding Hop DAO’s delegate-incentive scheme, noting that only six delegates qualified in the latest six-month cycle and that average payouts were about $300, too low, he argues, to attract and keep engaged voters. He proposes scrapping the current complexity (vesting schedules, penalty rules and rolling participation periods) and replacing it with a simpler two-tier system: delegates who cast votes and post rationales on at least 50 % of Snapshot and Tally proposals would earn a baseline reward, while those hitting 75% participation would receive triple that amount. The requirement to maintain 30k HOP in delegated voting power would remain, and rationales would become mandatory so rewards can eventually be automated. Community members are invited to comment before the framework is finalised.

## **Polygon**

### **Polygon Delegate Incentive Program (DIP) - Q1 Report**

Polygon’s Delegate Incentive Program (DIP) has closed its first quarter and [published a report](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/polygon-delegate-incentive-program-dip-q1-report/20952) that outlines how $60k worth of POL was distributed among the sixteen active delegate teams, highlights early outreach results, and captures feedback that will shape future rounds.

Because no formal votes occurred in Q1, the weighting tilted toward “awareness creation” and ecosystem engagement rather than voting activity. Posts from delegates drew more than 110,000 views on X, and pieces such as Diminiko’s delegate-mapping and Lumia’s program explainer were cited as standout contributions. Deniz (Lumia) topped the overall earnings table at roughly $12.9k, followed by Gosha/Prom, John/Node Infra and Diminiko/BountyBlok; each share reflects a mix of three reward streams: social-reach scores, on-chain voting participation (the >70 % threshold still applied even though there were no proposals) and delegated POL voting power. In addition, three one-off “special” prizes were granted for the quarter: Lumia took the Amplifier award for highest awareness, Node Infra won Beacon for most substantive forum work, and BountyBlok received Trailblazer for broader community contribution.

Administrative churn saw Aave Chan Initiative removed for missing the 30,000-POL delegation floor, while Ignas opted out. Tané and Yanshu filled their seats and were selected from the original applicant pool. A short survey of ten delegates found that onboarding and Foundation communication were smooth, but several respondents asked for more precise quarterly objectives as governance activity ramps up. The Polygon Foundation welcomed the early momentum and said it is eager to watch engagement deepen once major proposals begin hitting the forum.

The three incentive buckets remain in place for Q2, yet the report notes that the weighting will shift to reward on-chain participation more heavily once voting volume picks up. The organisers encourage delegates to keep producing public-facing content while preparing for an increasingly active governance calendar.

### **Mid Report | Lisk DAO Season 1**

SuperchainEco has [created a post](https://forum.lisk.com/t/mid-report-lisk-dao-season-1/322) that outlines the mid-report of the Lisk DAO season 1. Eight weeks into Season 1, Lisk DAO is beginning to gather momentum after a deliberately slow set-up period. The grants council and steering committee spent the first month wiring up a Charmverse-based “DAO Hub,” talking to builders and ecosystem players, and tightening the application template; since mid-April, more than twenty grant requests have landed, five have been approved, and 123.5 k LSK has been earmarked for milestone-based payouts, though only 41 k LSK has left the treasury so far. Early lessons suggest most teams are still testing ideas, so the council has shifted from chasing large TVL plays to smaller MVP-style grants in the 15k–25k LSK range while waiving the original rule that all work must finish before the June 11 season close.

The season’s second budget track—“Builder Programs”—has yet to disburse funds. Still, a live vote would commit the full 400k LSK allocation to three regional incubators: AyaHQ in Africa, Lisk Spark in Indonesia, and the Key Difference Pioneer accelerator. If passed, each programme will extend Lisk’s 2024 builder-tour playbook and feed a fresh cohort of teams into the mainnet.

Liquidity incentives under the “Ecosystem Incentives” banner are already running. A DeFi campaign called Lisk Surge, built with Jumper and Velodrome, has approved 1.05M LSK of the 2.5M LSK pool and paid out 192.5 k LSK in its first phase. The nine-week initiative rotates through WETH, USDT0, and WBTC pools in three-week blocks, aims to grow non-LSK TVL, and will publish a public post-mortem once rewards are distributed.

With 476k LSK still uncommitted in builder grants and 1.45M LSK unallocated in liquidity incentives, the council expects disbursements to pick up over the next month, even though the nominal season end is close. A full report is scheduled for the week of 17–20 June; the authors hint that a Season 2—synchronised with the team’s development roadmap, the airdrop schedule and governance cycles—would let the community judge the wisdom of the proposed LSK token burn on richer data, probably late in the year. Until then, stakeholders are encouraged to use the new DAO Hub, try the Surge pools, and provide feedback so the remaining funds can be steered where they matter most.

### **Notice of Emergency Upgrade**

ZKsync’s team [discovered](https://forum.zknation.io/t/notice-of-emergency-upgrade/680) a flaw in the sequencer’s virtual-machine code last Wednesday night that produced a batch the prover could not verify on Abstract, stalling finalisation (and therefore withdrawals) across the Elastic Network. Engineers patched the VM, pushed the fix to every chain, and—after manual validation by the Security Council—executed an emergency protocol upgrade approved by Guardians, the Council, and the Foundation to finalise the problematic batch. Transaction processing never stopped, no user funds were endangered, and a detailed post-mortem is now being prepared.


### **[ZIP-11] V28 Precompile Upgrade**

Matter Labs has [introduced](https://forum.zknation.io/t/zip-11-v28-precompile-upgrade/679) ZKsync’s v28 precompile upgrade, which bakes four heavy-duty Ethereum precompiles—ECAdd, ECMul, ECPairing, and ModExp—directly into the ZkVM circuits. Shifting these elliptic-curve and modular-exponentiation tasks from L2 contract code to purpose-built zk-circuits slashes gas: Matter Labs’ Sepolia tests show zkSNARK-proof verification falling from about 6.8M gas to 0.37 million (≈ 94 % cut). Each precompile mirrors Ethereum’s interface but now runs with in-circuit input checks, mixed-coordinate math, and torus-compressed pairing loops; the change is invisible to existing contracts at the familiar addresses 0x06–0x08 plus ModExp. The upgrade also renders consensus-layer additions stateless, paving the way for future snap-sync and full stateless verification. All code is live in the release-v28 branches of era-contracts and zksync-protocol; internal tests, Distributed Lab co-development, and audits by OpenZeppelin, SpearBit, and Cantina have found the cryptography sound. V28 will be deployed once governance approves ZIP-11, with no breaking changes for dApps but a significant drop in on-chain cryptography costs.


### **Proposal Review Call May 21 - Thread**

Theshelb [has created](https://forum.zknation.io/t/proposal-review-call-may-21-thread/683) a forum post to set up ZKsync’s next Proposal Review call, scheduled for Wednesday, 21 May. Authors of live or in-progress proposals can ask for a slot to walk delegates through their work and field questions. Shelby will collate the requests and post a final running order on the day, then use that agenda to steer the discussion. A calendar link is provided so delegates can add the recurring meetings to their diaries. The tentative docket already lists the emergency batch-providing hot-fix, three on-chain ZIPs—activating ZK Gateway (ZIP-10), the v28 precompile upgrade (ZIP-11), and the ETH-to-ZK conversion mandate (GAP-3)—plus two Token Program Proposals covering audit-cost reimbursement (TPP-3) and the shutdown of old Ignite minters (TPP-4).

### **Proposal: Ecosystem Growth Council Formation**

Eugene, from the Scroll Foundation, [proposes creating](https://forum.scroll.io/t/proposal-ecosystem-growth-council-formation/718) a seven-member Ecosystem Growth Council (EGC) to give Scroll DAO its first dedicated body for funding and supervising business-development initiatives. The council would sit for six months, meeting at least twice a month, publishing minutes and a closing report, and devoting about ten hours a week per member. Membership would blend two Foundation staffers, three to four delegates, and one to two outside growth professionals; selection would be handled by the governance team, with room for an election if delegates prefer.

The DAO would earmark 2M SCR. Up to 380k SCR covers overhead—stipends, tooling, comms—while at least 1.62M  is reserved for actual programmes such as liquidity drives or founder accelerators. The EGC could authorise grants by internal vote: spending under 25 % of the pot needs four yeses out of seven; bigger allocations require six. Once an internal vote passes, delegates have a three-day veto window: if five active delegates request a Snapshot and a majority backs the veto, the proposal goes back for revision or, after a second rejection, to a full DAO ballot. Any attempt to tap the budget for non-growth items also needs a 6/7 EGC super-majority plus the veto window.

Success will be judged less on hard metrics—the first funded initiative may only just be getting underway by November—than on governance hygiene: timely meetings, public documentation, thorough RFP responses, and smooth handling of any veto challenges. The overarching target is to have at least one focused ecosystem-growth programme live by August, laying the groundwork to bring twenty highly aligned Scroll founders into the fold.


### **Proposal: Increase Votable Supply with Incentivized Delegation Vaults (IDVs)**

Event Horizon [has proposed](https://forum.scroll.io/t/proposal-increase-votable-supply-with-incentivized-delegation-vaults-idvs/709/1) a lightweight yet durable fix for the network’s chronic “low-votable-supply” risk: pay ordinary holders a temporary yield to delegate their SCR to active delegates through Incentivised Delegation Vaults. Delegation requires only a signature—no staking, custody, or gas—and Event Horizon’s back-end tracks balances off-chain, then airdrops weekly SCR rewards pro rata. Because delegations, once made, are rarely re-shuffled, the extra voting power should remain long after emissions stop, filtering into the hands of the most active representatives and slowly sidelining dormant wallets without ever lowering quorum.

The request is for 457,000 SCR, 320k to seed six months of rewards, capped at a 15 % APR, and 137k to cover development, infrastructure, and a referral layer that lets any delegate or KOL earn credit for bringing fresh balances into the vaults. Event Horizon says earlier pilots cost roughly one dollar in emissions for every thousand dollars of new voting weight, and they expect a similar 2.6 M SCR bump here. Mid-programme and end-of-programme reports would show the exact ratio of emitted tokens to extra delegated supply.


### **Kenya Local Node - Regional Evaluation**

Web3Clubs [proposes](https://forum.scroll.io/t/kenya-local-node-regional-evaluation/728/1) to lead a Scroll node, leveraging its physical Nairobi lab, database of 100-plus projects, policy arm (the Virtual Assets Chamber), and partnerships with the Ministry of ICT and Konza Technopolis. The first deliverable would be a three-month founder programme: onboarding high-potential teams, guiding them through Scroll’s stack, pairing them with legal, venture, and technical mentors, and showcasing them at demo days. Support requested from Scroll includes operating funds, technical liaison, visibility across official channels, and help securing regional VC and compliance partners.

By embedding Scroll in Kenya’s payments, remittance, and RWA tokenization surge and feeding a pipeline of twenty or more Scroll-native startups over the next few years, the node aims to make Nairobi a flagship African hub for the roll-up ecosystem while giving Scroll a first-mover advantage as the country’s regulatory framework crystallises.


### **Kenya Scroll Node Founder Program Proposal**

Web3Clubs — the Nairobi-based incubator that already anchors a 5,000-member developer network and maintains close ties to Kenya’s regulators, exchanges, and mobile-money giants — [is asking Scroll DAO for a one-off](https://forum.scroll.io/t/kenya-scroll-node-founder-program-proposal/730) grant of $33k (≈ 89 k SCR) to run a three-month “Scroll Founder Programme.” The cohort would shepherd five to ten African teams from idea to on-chain launch, using Scroll’s Open Zero curriculum and a three-stage pipeline dubbed Msingi (foundation), Daraja (bridge), and Vuka (go-to-market). Founders would spend two weeks in orientation, six weeks refining business models and MVPs under local and global mentors, then six weeks inside the Open Zero track polishing UX, demos, and growth plans before a Nairobi demo day and listing on [openeconomy.xyz](openeconomy.xyz). Success will be judged on complex outputs—at least five Scroll-deployed MVPs, three integrations with banks or payment rails, three sandbox applications to Kenya’s Capital-Markets Authority—and on softer targets such as seventy new Scroll-aligned developers and one team graduating into Open Campus or securing outside funding.
