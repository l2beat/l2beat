[AIP: Security Council Election Process Improvements](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xb41324ddcc115d08149b192e0b8ae4cfad0ef39cecb5663ea63d8a460d2cb3cc) - ends on September 11 at 22:11 UTC.

[Revert the Delegate Incentive Program (DIP) to Version 1.5](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xb1a39a0b7543e03cbb7aca0213448f4fbed4cbf1157fcb1b2458540fb452bc73) - ends on September 11 at 22:11 UTC.


### **The Watchdog Program: Get Rewarded for Reporting Suspected Grant Misuse**

Entropy [created a post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/the-watchdog-program-get-rewarded-for-reporting-suspected-grant-misuse/29919/1) outlining the launch of the Watchdog Arbitrum’s grant-misuse bounty program, and opened a portal for confidential, evidence-based reports. A three-member committee (Arbitrum Foundation, Entropy Advisors, SeedGov) will review cases under a broad misuse definition. Valid reports earn ARB based on severity (Low: 1k ARB base, cap $10k; Medium: 10k ARB, cap $25k; High: 30k ARB, cap $100k), with potential extra rewards from any recovered funds paid in the recovered asset; KYC with the Foundation is required to claim. The program operates until its 400k ARB budget is exhausted or it transitions to the OpCo.


### **Discussion: Improving the Arbitrum Security Council**

The Arbitrum Foundation [has created a post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/discussion-improving-the-arbitrum-security-council/29907) outlining potential improvements to the Security Council, including joint sourcing of stronger candidates with the DAO, longer election terms to reduce fatigue, and clearer expectations and ideal traits. The Foundation stays neutral on individuals vs. entities, but won’t allow nested multisigs for now; optional skills assessments may be tested. Compensation remains $5k/month in ARB with operations funded by the Foundation; the current DAO–SC relationship and flat structure stay in place, while the SC’s authority for routine, non-emergency changes is preserved. Feedback will inform the upcoming Security Council Election Process Improvements package headed to Snapshot this week.

### **September 2025 Security Council Election: Call for Candidates**

The Arbitrum Foundation [has officially announced](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/september-2025-security-council-election-call-for-candidates/29910?u=manugotsuka) the Call for Candidates for the September 2025 Security Council election, which is now open through September 15, when Contender Submissions will be accepted. Prospective applicants should review the “ideal qualities” and registration guides, announce their intent in a forum post tagged sep-2025-elections, and apply using a fresh EOA from a new (or reset) hardware wallet. The note also flags the ongoing Election Process Improvements discussion (changes would start in 2026 but could affect this cohort’s term length).

### **DRIP August Update**

Entropy has published a post showing a DRIP [August update](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/drip-august-update/29903) that confirms Season One went live on Sept 3 at 13:00 UTC. The program runs 20 weeks across 10 bi-weekly epochs (discovery, performance focus, then taper) with a 16M ARB base budget and up to 8M ARB discretionary. Season One targets leverage looping on Arbitrum One by rewarding borrowing against eligible yield-bearing ETH and stable assets across participating lenders. Entropy says the effort has already helped spur new deployments and listings, and [public dashboards](https://arbitrumdrip.com/) will track results. After parting ways with Objective Labs, Entropy’s data team is handling evaluation for now.

[Unichain Co-Incentives Growth Management Plan](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/uniswap/proposal/91) - ends on September 9 at 05:28 UTC.


### **Unichain Co-Incentives Growth Management Plan**

Doo_StableLab [created a post](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/unichain-co-incentives-growth-management-plan-governance-proposal/25814) explaining a Unichain co-incentives growth management plan for Uniswap DAO: build on the earlier Unichain-USDS strategy, lean on Sky’s yield (sUSDS & sUSDC) plus Spark co-incentives, and move to a “no result, no reward” model with higher KPIs. The program seeds $1M after on-chain + Snapshot approval, then releases up to $3M in performance unlocks, $1M at $60M, $100M, and $200M combined USDS/sUSDS/sUSDC on Unichain, always 80% to co-incentives / 20% ops. Incentives are rebalanced from the bottom 25% to the top 25% performing pools, with up to 5% reserved to seed emerging pools (max 2% per test pool). Governance cadence is roughly quarterly, with Snapshot strategy votes. UAC escrows funds and releases them based on on-chain proof of KPI hits.

## **Polygon**


### **Proposal: Educational Content And Community Growth On Polygon**

Tiza [created a post](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/proposal-educational-content-and-community-growth-on-polygon/21272) outlining a 4–6 week educational push to grow Polygon’s community, which includes publishing 2–3 explainer threads per week, custom infographics, hands-on “reply-guy” engagement, and impact analytics. The plan starts with zkEVM and DeFi explainers (weeks 1–2), then expands to gaming, infrastructure, and real-world adoption (weeks 3–4), with later content guided by community requests. The goal is to make Polygon’s tech more accessible and provide shareable assets for teams and advocates; if grants aren’t available, the author offers to begin on a volunteer basis to prove value.

## **ZkSync**


### **[TPP-DRAFT] ZKnomics Token Staking**

Dennison/Cliffton (Tally) [proposed](https://forum.zknation.io/t/tpp-draft-zknomics-token-staking/766) a 6-month staking pilot using Tally’s audited Staker contract to reward ZK holders who delegate to active delegates (voted ≥2/5 recent votes). Funding comes via capped minters totaling 37.5M ZK (10M Season 1, 25M Season 2, 2.5M ops) under a 10M ZK/month rate limit. Staking is non-locking, keeps delegation, and streams rewards over 30-day epochs targeting up to ~10% APY when caps are met. Goals: battle-test staking infra for future decentralized sequencing and lift active voting power from ~1B → ~2B ZK (S1 target 400M staked; S2 target 1B). Admin starts with a Program Administrator multisig; later shifts to token governance; the Security Council can pause, and the Token Assembly can revoke. UI will live at stake.zknation.io; audits, reporting, and capped-minter transparency included.


### **[ZIP-XX] Upgrade ZK Token with Permissionless Burn Function**

ScopeLift [proposed](https://forum.zknation.io/t/zip-xx-upgrade-zk-token-with-permissionless-burn-function/771) a ZKTokenV3, adding a public burn and a role-gated burnFrom, while exposing/enforcing a 21B maxSupply. The BURNER_ROLE admin moves to the Protocol Governor Timelock, paving the way for ZKnomics supply management and future fee-burn mechanisms. Minimal, backward-compatible change (≈19 SLOC); prior balances/permissions unaffected; audited by Offbeat Security.


### **Proposal Review Call September 10**

Shelby [has created](https://forum.zknation.io/t/proposal-review-call-september-10/774) a post for Wednesday’s community call. During this call the proposal authors will have the opportunity to explain their proposal ideas to the community. Right now the tentative agenda is: Q&A with @Be1garat on the Foundation Proposal Pipeline, plus discussions on ZIP-12 (Interop & Fast Finality), ZIP-XX (ZK token burn), Community Activation Pilot, Prividium Prize, ZKnomics Staking, and the DAO Liveness Dashboard.

### **Ecosystem Growth Council: Strategic Direction and Focus Areas**

The EGC [has created](https://forum.scroll.io/t/ecosystem-growth-council-strategic-direction-and-focus-areas/1119) a post to set a flexible, outcome-driven framework to guide funding and reviews, prioritizing: (1) builder onboarding/support, (2) liquidity & economic infrastructure (incl. stablecoins/RWAs, treasury diversification), and (3) user acquisition & retention tied to real PMF. Community building via local ecosystems remains under the Community Council’s remit, with the EGC coordinating but not funding directly. The council will back high-leverage, measurable initiatives and avoid short-term, unsustainable programs.


### **Proposal: KoalaGains: Standardized RWA Fund Blueprints & Launchpad on Scroll**

KoalaGains (DoDAO) [requested ](https://forum.scroll.io/t/proposal-koalagains-standardized-rwa-fund-blueprints-launchpad-on-scroll/1127)$135k for a 6–12 month push to make Scroll an RWA hub by shipping standardized, compliance-ready fund templates, custody and banking rails, and an LLM portal that auto-generates filings. Target impact: ~20x lower setup cost and ~10x faster launches. Deliverables include legal blueprints and an MVP, five reference asset launches, and DeFi integrations so RWA tokens can serve as collateral and treasury diversifiers. Budget split: $50–60k external counsel, $25–30k filings for pilots, $10k buffer, $35k fixed fee to DoDAO. Milestones cover kickoff, jurisdiction and partner selection, blueprint development, a five-asset pilot, and handoff, aiming to unlock idle capital, diversify TVL, and position Scroll as institution ready for RWAs.
