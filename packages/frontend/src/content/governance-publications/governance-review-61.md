## **Optimism**


### **Budget Board Advisory Proposal for Token House Missions: Seasons 8**

MSilb7 [has floated](https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-budget-board-advisory-proposal-for-token-house-missions-seasons-8/10103) a draft Season 8 budget that trims Governance-Fund spend to 7.28M OP, about 31% below the Season 4-7 average. The split is 6.33M OP for the Grants Council and 950k OP for the Developer Advisory Board, both scored “above baseline” because they underpin Superchain-interop launch work. At that cadence, plus the standing 4.4M OP/year DAO operating line, the fund would still have roughly 6.6 years of runway left.


### **S8 Retro Funding Missions**

The Optimism Foundation [has created](https://gov.optimism.io/t/s8-retro-funding-missions/10003) a post explaining that the Retro Funding will keep its two Season-7 tracks—On-chain Builders and Dev Tooling—and add a third, OP Stack Dependencies, for Season 8. Each of the first two buckets receives 8M OP to reward monthly impact (starting August) measured by OpenSource Observer’s data-driven algorithm: builders earn for TVL, transactions, gas, MAUs, and, once live, interop usage, while tool authors are paid for real-world adoption of compilers, libraries, debuggers, and soon block-explorer code. The new dependencies track sets aside 4M OP (payouts begin October) to fund Ethereum-core and other upstream components that the OP Stack relies on. The aim is to keep the Superchain’s critical infrastructure healthy, tighten developer alignment, and replace one-off grants with steady, results-based rewards.


### **RetroPGF/RF Evolution & Numbers**

ARDev097 [has assembled](https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-rf-evolution-numbers/10128?u=manugotsuka) a one-stop data set tracing RetroPGF’s journey from a $1M pilot to today’s 16M OP dual-track engine. The roundup covers budget creep (up to 30M OP at the 2023 peak), voter expansion from 24 to 178 participants, the shift from quadratic to metric-based algorithms, and the program’s rotating focus—from early infra to governance, tooling, and on-chain builders. Perennial beneficiaries like Protocol Guild and go-ethereum show how long-term public goods work keep getting rewarded, while newer growth plays such as Uniswap and Aerodrome capture impact-based grants.


### **Security Council Operating Budget Seasons 8 & 9**

Alisha [proposes](https://gov.optimism.io/t/security-council-operating-budget-seasons-8-9/10111) a 12-month budget of 1.86M OP to fund the 14-member Optimism Security Council from 1 July 2025 to 30 June 2026. Each signer and the lead would stream 8,955 OP per month, totalling 752,220 OP per season, with an additional 346,920 OP paid retroactively for Season 7’s heavier workload (19 upgrade ceremonies across five OP Chains). A small 10k OP pool covers hardware and tooling. Key KPIs remain block-upgrade turnaround, signer liveness, and annual emergency rehearsals; no charter changes are requested this cycle.

## **Arbitrum**


## **Active Votes**

**Temp-check**

[Updating the Code of Conduct & DAO’s Procedures](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xd3d164905fee7dfd8516db6150a97f7f91cf6f9377f614fa6a82333c4fb20546) - ends on July 24 at 12:30 UTC.


### **Request for a Maintenance Upgrades Working Group**

We, L2BEAT, [asked](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/request-for-a-maintenance-upgrades-working-group/29634) the Arbitrum DAO, Foundation, and Offchain Labs to join a new working group that would draft a streamlined path for routine tasks—like token-gateway registrations or small parameter tweaks—so they no longer need full constitutional votes. L2BEAT will organise the meetings and ensure any design keeps top-level DAO control; no funds are requested. If there are no major objections after a week’s forum discussion, the group will convene bi-weekly to scope solutions.


### **Proposal - Updates to the DIP, The Complete 1.7 Version**

SEEDGov has created the “[DIP v1.7](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-updates-to-the-dip-the-complete-1-7-version/29635),” a major tune-up of Arbitrum’s Delegate Incentive Program that will run until October 2025. The revamp adds a new “Tier X” that lets high-power delegates (≥ 500 k ARB) earn a small stipend for simply voting, while overall payments across all tiers fall by roughly 40% percent. Rewards inside each tier will now scale in proportion to a delegate’s score rather than paying everyone the same cap. The plan also raises the entry bar for newcomers from 50k to 500k ARB, bars vote-buying platforms, and rewrites the delegate-feedback metric so only remarks that demonstrably shape proposals—or are vouched for by proposers or large stakeholders—count. Subjective disputes disappear; delegates may contest only objective data like missed votes. A set of explicit Terms & Conditions empowers SEEDGov to issue penalties, suspensions, or expulsions, with appeals handled by the Arbitrum Foundation. The team will also run a business-development push to coax more large holders (+500k ARB) into active voting.


### **Consolidate Idle USDC to the ATMC’s Stablecoin Balance**

Entropy [created a proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/consolidate-idle-usdc-to-the-atmc-s-stablecoin-balance/29619) to shut down three dormant budgets—the 2025 Events pot (~ $1.04 M USDC), the unused balance of ARDC v2 (~ $1.5 M USDC plus 112 k ARB), and whatever USDC remains after the ADPC security-subsidy program ends—and roll every dollar into the Arbitrum Treasury Management Committee’s stable-coin address, where DAO-approved managers can earn on-chain yield instead of letting the funds sit idle. Large events would henceforth fall under the Arbitrum Foundation’s remit, while small community gatherings could tap the D.A.O. program. If the Snapshot on 24 July passes, the transfers from the Events and ARDC wallets will happen within a week; the ADPC leftovers will follow once contractual payouts are complete.


### **Proposal: Launch Arbitrum App Store & Builder Communities Hub on Common Ground**

Florian [has created](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-launch-arbitrum-app-store-builder-communities-hub-on-common-ground/29621) a proposal that pitches Arbitrum on moving its Discord/Telegram activity to a new Web3-native chat platform that doubles as a community-curated “mini-app” store. The rollout would start with trial spaces, followed by incentivized migration, culminating in a full ecosystem hub where users can discover and run Arbitrum dApps—such as DEXes, games, and governance tools—without leaving the chat. The team requests approximately $160,000 in ARB-denominated USDC for a one-year platform subscription, small builder grants, and migration rewards, with the DAO receiving an equal value of $CG governance tokens in return.


### **OpCo July 2025 Update**

OpCo’s [July update](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/opco-july-2025-update/29636) says the oversight-and-transparency committee (OAT) is still staffing up. Interviews are underway for a “Chief Chaos Coordinator” to run the new OpCo foundation, and a few strong candidates could join in other roles even before that hire is final. Weekly OAT meetings continue; bylaws are nearly ready to publish. On the DAO side, OAT has begun reviewing Entropy’s treasury-management allocations and will serve as Entropy’s counterparty once the Year 2-3 advisory contract and its 10M ARB incentive pool are approved.

## **Starknet**


### **Proposal for the Monetary Committee: Adjusting the Inflation Coefficient (c) to Support Sustainable Staking Participation**

Manor [has created](https://community.starknet.io/t/proposal-for-the-monetary-committee-adjusting-the-inflation-coefficient-c-to-support-sustainable-staking-participation/115775) a proposal that asks Starknet’s Monetary Committee to bump the network’s inflation-coefficient “c” from 1.6 to roughly 3. Manor argues staking is only ~4 % of supply—well below the 10 % they view as a safe floor—and yields will drop too fast as participation rises. Raising “c” would keep STRK staking returns near 10-15 % (and future BTC-staking yields around 2-6 %) while holding annual inflation to 0.4-1.5 %. They hope to finalize feedback and send a formal request to the committee by late July.

## **Scroll**


### **Announcing the Ecosystem Growth Council (EGC)**

The Scroll Foundation [has unveiled](https://forum.scroll.io/t/announcing-the-ecosystem-growth-council-egc/962) the inaugural Ecosystem Growth Council: internal seats go to Eugene and Mark, while the three external spots are shared by JuanRah & 0xDonPepe, Natalie Tillack & Jashar Seyfi, and Sov. Delegates have three business days to lodge any veto; barring objections, the council will hold its first meeting between 18-22 July and spend the next six months designing, launching, and transparently tracking Scroll DAO’s first growth-funding program before drafting a renewal charter.


### **Announcing the Governance Contribution Reward Working Group**

The Scroll Foundation [has set up](https://forum.scroll.io/t/announcing-the-governance-contribution-reward-working-group/963/1) a three-member Governance Contribution Recognition working group to design the DAO’s next six-month incentive scheme. Seats go to Bitblondy, Proxy (sharing one seat), and Seiryu, chosen for their blend of delegate-incentive, economics, and active-governance experience. Delegates have three business days to lodge any veto; if none arrive, the trio will begin work on a fresh GCR proposal slated for the 1 September voting cycle.


### **Grant Progress Tracking Platform for Scroll**

BuildUnion [has created](https://forum.scroll.io/t/grant-progress-tracking-platform-for-scroll/975?u=manugotsuka) a proposal that seeks a one-off $5000 grant to ship and run for a year a public “Grant Progress Tracker” that pulls every Scroll-funded project into a single dashboard. The tool would show live milestone percentages, funding streams, and ML-flagged risk scores, trigger email/app alerts for delays or scope drift, and give grant stewards admin controls to intervene, ultimately giving the community real-time, portfolio-wide transparency instead of scattered forum and Discord updates.
