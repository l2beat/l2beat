      <p>
        Thank you for choosing to donate to L2BEAT. Your contribution supports
        our continuous efforts to bring education and transparency to the L2
        space.
      </p>

        L2BEAT is an analytics and research website about Ethereum layer two
        (L2) scaling. We provide a comparison of the various Ethereum L2 systems
        available today. Because of our commitment to education we present
        various non-trivial metrics aside from Total Value Locked (TVL). We have
        carefully examined each L2 project to determine the inner workings of
        their technology as well as the associated risks.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the future we plan to introduce more metrics as well as build special
        purpose tools for various L2s that empower users to execute operations
        like forced transactions or view L2 state from the perspective of L1.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are a small and independent team. Your support means a lot to us.
      </p>
      <p>Thank you!</p>
      <p>&mdash; L2BEAT Team</p>
