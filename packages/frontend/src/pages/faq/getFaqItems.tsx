        'Why do you need L2BEAT if you have DeFi Pulse, DefiLlama, etc.?',
      answer:
        'While the above-mentioned sites are great, they focus primarily at tracking TVL (Total Value Locked) in DeFi projects on various chain. In comparison L2BEAT will track only L2 projects (at first on Ethereum only) and will eventually report not just TVL but various metrics related to the liveness and security of these projects.',
    },

      question:
        'Why does the Total Value Locked (TVL) on L2BEAT differ from the one on DefiLlama?',
      answer: (
        <div>
          <p className="mt-4">
            L2BEAT and DefiLlama use different methodologies for calculating
            TVL. The TVL on L2BEAT is a sum of canonically bridged, externally
            bridged, and natively minted assets (e.g. L2-native governance
            tokens like ARB and OP), while DefiLlama focuses on assets actively
            engaged in dApps on specific networks.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            Example: let's assume L2BEAT reports a TVL of 2.5 billion, while
            DefiLlama reports a TVL of 1 billion for the same Layer 2 network
            (e.g., Arbitrum). This suggests that 1.5 billion worth of assets
            have been bridged (canonically or externally) or natively minted on
            Arbitrum, but are not yet being used in any dApps listed by
            DefiLlama. For instance, if you deposit 1 ETH to Optimism, L2BEAT
            would include it in their TVL calculation, but DefiLlama would not.
            However, if you use that 1 ETH on Optimism to provide liquidity on
            Uniswap, DefiLlama would then include it in their TVL calculation.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            The discrepancy in reported TVL between L2BEAT and DefiLlama is due
            to different interpretations of "Total Value Locked." L2BEAT
            considers the entire Ethereum ecosystem, while DefiLlama emphasizes
            assets used in dApps on individual blockchain networks.

            There are two primary (and somewhat independent) mechanisms that L2
            chains use.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            First, the L2 state can be verified by L1 through either{' '}
            <Strong>Validity Proofs</Strong> or <Strong>Fraud Proofs</Strong>.
            This mechanism is most important as it ensures that L2 proposers
            cannot cheat and include invalid transactions in an L2 block, e.g.
            mint coins out of thin air or steal your coins.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            The second use of L1 is as a <Strong>Data Availability</Strong>{' '}
            layer for L2 transactions so that users can independently re-create
            the L2 state and ensure continued and safe system operation or
            trustlessly exit to L1.
          </p>
        </div>
      ),
    },
    {
      question: 'Can you explain how L1 can help with L2 state validation?',
      answer: (
        <div>
          <p className="mt-4">
            An L2 chain can periodically "commit" its state to L1 by submitting
            the hash of its current state root. A state root is just a number,
            e.g: <code>0x77905a71f4b32221...</code> . We need a mechanism to
            ensure that this number corresponds to the actual L2 state.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            One way to do so is by providing a cryptographic{' '}
            <Strong>Validity Proof</Strong> (zkProof) that will be verified by
            the L1 smart contract. If the verification passes, users can be sure
            that the state root represents the results of valid transaction
            execution.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            Alternatively, an honest L2 chain observer can challenge roots. They
            can do this by producing a <Strong>Fraud Proof</Strong>. This proof
            empowers the L1 contract to autonomously confirm the inaccuracy of
            the state root and subsequently reject it.

        'What if an L2 proposer submit a fraudulent state commit to L1?',
      answer: (
        <>
          A state root from L2 is typically used to check coin ownership on L2
          that user wants to withdraw to L1. If the fraudulent state root is
          submitted, it may attest that all coins belong to a dishonest L2
          validator rather than legitimate users. These coins can be then
          withdrawn to L1 from L2&mdash;effectively stealing them. This is why
          it is not enough to simply commit state roots of L2 to L1, we need to
          be sure that this state root is valid.

        "Are there any other ways L2 validators can steal user's coins?",

        'Most L2 constructions are upgradable and until upgradability mechanism is either fully disabled or controlled by a sufficiently decentralised DAO, the funds can be, in theory, stolen through the upgrade mechanism. L2BEAT will closely monitor how the particular construction is upgradable and who currently controls the upgradability keys.',

      question: 'What about data availability? Why is it important?',
      answer: (
        <div>
          <p className="mt-4">
            To trustlessly withdraw coins from L2, users need to prove ownership
            of the coins to L1 smart contract that holds all the funds. For that
            they need to have access to all L2's transactions or its current
            state. To not introduce any additional trust assumptions, L2
            transactions can simply be recorded on L1 (as cheap calldata).
