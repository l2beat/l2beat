                In recent years the Ethereum L2s ecosystem has grown
                tremendously in terms of the number of available systems, the
                number of different system architectures, and their complexity.
                As a direct consequence, a deeper understanding of the
                management mechanisms of these systems has grown increasingly
                important. Almost all present-day L2s are equipped with some
                form of upgrade mechanism, whether a code implementation upgrade
                or system parameters update. Given that these systems are in
                their relative infancy and continue to evolve, it&apos;s
                reasonable to expect that these upgrade mechanisms will remain
                an essential aspect of L2s for the foreseeable future.

                This report is a snapshot of our current knowledge as of June
                2023. In the report, we delve into various aspects of system
                upgradeability. We start with why and when we need Layer 2s to
                be upgradable, both from a user’s and an operator’s perspective.
                We go through different aspects that need to be considered when
                thinking about code upgradeability and managing system
                parameters, and we finish with our recommendations regarding the
                design of the systems architecture and safety measures. Attached
                at the end, you will find our analysis of 8 existing L2s and how
                they approached upgradeability and management. For every
                project, we focus primarily on the technical and organizational
                aspects, leaving away considerations regarding the governance
                structures and processes.
