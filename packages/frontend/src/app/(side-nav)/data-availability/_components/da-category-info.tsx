      Public DA layers are data availability solutions designed for broad,
      general use across multiple scaling projects. These solutions aim to be
      flexible, scalable, and accessible to a wide range of users without
      significant modifications or integration efforts.

      Custom DA layers are data availability solutions that are tightly
      integrated with a single scaling project and would require substantial
      modifications for public use. They are tailored to the specific needs of
      one project, making them less adaptable for general or broader
      applications.
