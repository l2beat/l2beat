  "term": "Proto-danksharding (EIP-4844)",
  "definition": "The proposal that implemented most of the logic and architecture that make up a full Danksharding spec (eg. transaction formats, verification rules), but not yet actually implementing any sharding (i.e. data availability sampling). In a proto-danksharding implementation, all validators and users still have to directly validate the availability of the full data. The main difference with calldata is that blobs do not interact with the execution layer and are deleted after a certain period of time.",
