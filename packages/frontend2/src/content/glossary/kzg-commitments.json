  "term": "KZG commitments",
  "definition": "A polynomial commitment scheme that allows a prover to compute a commitment to a polynomial, with the properties that this commitment can later be opened at any position: the prover shows that the value of the polynomial at a certain position is equal to a claimed value.\nKZG is widely used as itâ€™s applicable both for univariate and k-variate polynomials, is efficient for batch proofs, and is able to generate many proofs at once relatively fast. It is also proof generation time efficient: the time for prover to commit to a polynomial is linear on the degree of the polynomial.",
