## **Arbitrum**

### **On Chain Vote - Arbitrum Stable Treasury Endowment Program**

The proposal for the Stable Treasury Endowment Program (STEP) aims to support the budding RWA ecosystem on Arbitrum by diversifying 35 million ARB from the treasury into assets that are stable in value with minimal volatility, liquid in conversion, and provide yield uncorrelated to crypto markets that is at least commensurate with the so-called "risk-free rate of return" of US Treasuries.

The [Tally vote](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/38070839538623347085766954167338451189998347523518753197890888828931691912919) ends on April 6 2024 at 1:56 pm UTC.

### **Temp Check - Expand Tally Support for the Arbitrum DAO**

This proposal by Tally seeks to expand our support for the Arbitrum DAO by improving the proposal process, upgrading the Governor contracts, and highlighting delegate contributions. The proposal requests a total budget of $220,000 in ARB and has a timeline of 4,5 months for completion.

The [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x1204041955b729052b9adb4da9e3fa9a03c415ca45aeefd5c41da4d9d45ea851) ends on March 26 2024 at 9:52 pm UTC.

### **Security Council Elections**

The elections for the next cohort of the Security Council have begun. The registrations have closed and now we’ll move on to the nominee selection phase with the elections set to take place on April 12th.

You can view the [candidates’ applications here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/security-council-elections/12).

### **[RFC] Don’t let OP beat ARB in supporting POKT Network Retro PGF**

B3nnn [submitted an RFC](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-don-t-let-op-beat-arb-in-supporting-pokt-network-retro-pgf/22571?u=disruptionjoe) that aims to request 50,000 ARB to support our effort and match OP’s $ value. POKT Network has a current proposal to test out RetroPGF. They have 60,000 OP and 75,000 ARB which have been given as grants by both ecosystems. Their retroPGF round aims to redistribute these tokens to the open-source contributors and community members who directly created the impact behind POKT.

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

We’re curious to hear your thoughts on the idea of providing long-term support to Tally as we mentioned above. Additionally, there’s currently a big proposal and discussion around gaming on Arbitrum which we’re interested in discussing with other delegates and Arbitrum stakeholders.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss all of the above and more during our [Arbitrum Office Hours](meet.google.com/jkj-nnop-arc) every Thursday at 4 pm UTC.

## **Uniswap**

### **Mobilizing the Uniswap Treasury**

Abdullah Umar from Arana Digital [submitted an RFC](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/mobilizing-the-uniswap-treasury/23397?u=abdullahumar) that proposes the creation of the Uniswap Treasury Working Group (UTWG) to explore treasury management strategies aimed at achieving sustainability and growth for the DAO. The UTWG will comprise 4 members, 2 of which will be Arana Digital and StableLabs (co-authors of the proposal).

The proposal requests a budget of 6,000 $UNI for 8 weeks of research, resulting in a deliverable of at least two viable treasury management options for the DAO to begin pursuing. Both of these options will be presented as their individual RFC/RFP, ideally allowing treasury managers to present their products and services to the DAO

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

Uniswap has a huge treasury that is almost in its entirety based on its native token, UNI. That means that the dollar amount should be heavily discounted. Diversifying the treasury into stables or revenue-generating investments makes sense and we should allocate resources as a DAO to ensure we carry out the diversification in the best way possible.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss the above and more during our [Uniswap Office Hours](http://meet.google.com/twm-jafw-esn) every Friday at 4 pm UTC.

## **Hop**

### **[RFC] Launch Hop on NEO X (NEO EVM) Mainnet**

NeoX has [submitted an RFC](https://forum.hop.exchange/t/request-for-comment-launch-hop-on-neo-x-neo-evm-mainnet/1136) that proposes the deployment of Hop to NEO EVM rollup known as “NEO X”. There are no specifications offered in the proposal and the post itself seems like a copy-pasted proposal that was drafted for another protocol.

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

There have been several proposals in the past to deploy Hop on different chains. Having a way to process them without having to go through the governance process (which is time-consuming and costly for delegates) is reasonable.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss the above and more during our [Hop Office Hours](http://meet.google.com/twm-jafw-esn) every Friday at 4 pm UTC.

## **Polygon**

### **Open Source Contributors - A promising alternative to idea based funding**

Lovegrovegeorge[ published a post](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/open-source-contributors-a-promising-alternative-to-idea-based-funding/13673) that utlines the suggestion of experimenting with directly funding a small number of open source developers that would help with developing any open source initiatives - this could include improving any existing pieces of software used in the ecosystem or creating entirely new tools and libraries.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss all things Polygon during our [Polygon Office Hours](meet.google.com/avz-chuc-ksa) every Friday at 3 pm UTC.

## **Starknet**

### **Starknet Emission and Tokenomics Simulator**

Aleksandar [published a post](https://community.starknet.io/t/starknet-emission-and-tokenomics-simulator/113756) announcing that they developed a streamlit dashboard designed to enhance the understanding of the tokenomics behind STRK and encourage experimentation with various vesting schedules as some portions of the vesting are still not known.

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

We’re interested in discussing with other Starknet delegates and discussing

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss all things Starknet more during our [Starknet Office Hours](http://meet.google.com/avz-chuc-ksa) every Friday at 3 pm UTC.

## **Connext**

### **Vote - Retroactive Funding Proposal for xPollinate Development**

This proposal asks for a one-time retroactive payment of 360,000 NEXT for the 1Hive contributors towards building out the Connext xPollinate bridge that delivered $1.2B in volume in its first year of operation. This project was exempt from the initial allocation of NEXT tokens and that’s why they’re asking for retroactive compensation.

The [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/dao.connext.eth/proposal/0x8192bf06ee51c65583fc0b5c22029bfb8751fb5a5f203fc6a3f0a06a68a50f96) ends on March 24 2024 at 08:40 am UTC

### **[RFC] DAO Treasury Diversification**

Jengajojo [submitted an RFC](https://forum.connext.network/t/temp-check-dao-treasury-diversification/1095) that seeks to serve as a conversation opener for the topic of diversifying the DAO’s treasury, which currently holds ~$75M (264,937,987 $NEXT & 5 $ETH) 99.97% of which is the native token.

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

Treasury diversification is important for ensuring the longevity of the DAO and securing a runway for operational expenses. We want to invite people to our office hours to discuss how we can create a workstream to tackle treasury diversification.
