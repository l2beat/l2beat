## **Optimism**


### **Experimenting with Deliberative Processes in the Collective**

Inspired by a community member’s post, [Optimism Foundation announced that they will be testing Deliberative Processes](https://gov.optimism.io/t/experimenting-with-deliberative-processes-in-the-collective/8041), among other processes, during Retro Funding 4.

In its modern meaning, deliberation refers to a collective decision-making process that aims to reduce the impact of power structures in the discussion. In practice, it generally involves a set of three principles:



1. Informed, structured, and facilitated discussion of the pros and cons of a topic.
2. A process that progresses from individual opinions towards collective judgment.
3. A recruitment of a representative group to have the discussion. This is mostly achieved through “sortition” (random selection of participants).

A subset of 50 Round 4 voters will be randomly selected to participate in the deliberative experiment. This subset of voters will deliberate on a topic of relevance to Retro Funding Round 4, facilitated by a team specialized in designing and running such processes.


### **[RFC] Donate to Roman Storm & Alexey Pertsev’s legal defense fund**

Brileigh [submitted an RFC](https://gov.optimism.io/t/rfc-donate-to-roman-storm-alexey-pertsev-s-legal-defense-fund/8057) that seeks to discuss a potential donation from Optimism Collective to the legal defense of Tornado Cash developers Roman Storm & Alexey Pertsev, facilitated through JusticeDAO, which is advocating on their behalf and helping to raise funds for their legal defense.

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

Other DAOs have also contributed to organizations advocating (directly or indirectly) for Roman Storm and Alexey Pertsev. One of the main considerations was the legal implications of doing so for the DAO and the associated Foundations. We should ensure that any action we take is completely covered from a legal perspective.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss the above and more during our [Optimism Office Hours](meet.google.com/pem-jzrh-gkq) every Tuesday at 3 pm UTC.


## **Arbitrum**


### **On Chain Vote - GovHack at ETH CC (Brussels)**

Following a [successful temp-check](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x3ad664cfc7e8340e43608cfad131c1cd4d4f635a465877671766043334d45e6e) with overwhelming support, [the proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/govhack-at-eth-cc-brussels/23305) by Hack Humanity and Entropy Advisors to host a GovHack during ETH CC in Brussels has moved to an on-chain vote. 

The [Tally proposal](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/2318647337263564305) ends on May 19 2024 at 3:14 am UTC.


### **Temp Check - Proposal for Approval of DeDaub as the ADPC Security Advisor**

In response to the need for enhancing security measures, the ADPC [proposed the onboarding of DeDaub](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/adding-a-security-sme-to-the-adpc/23526?u=sid_areta), a renowned security services firm, to assist the ADPC as a security advisor. If the proposal is successful, it would preclude DeDaub from being whitelisted by the ADPC as a security provider to avoid a conflict of interest.

The [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xddfa0a249ebf8b1c4c17cb67b4ec1cea69b255815f23a9de35673d8c7d477afc) ends on May 9 2024 at 2:17 pm UTC


### **Arbitrum Research and Development Collective (ARDC) Update**

As per the original mandate, we (L2BEAT), in our capacity as DAO Advocate, [published a monthly update](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ardc-dao-advocate-communication-thread/22865/2) on what the ARDC has been working on for the past month.

We want to remind everyone that you can follow along with the status of the ARDC on the [Notion page](https://loving-bank-303.notion.site/ARDC-Homepage-955753d44ff74dc985d498c10cb361b0?pvs=74) we’ve set up and that you can request work by the ARDC simply by getting in touch with us. You can reach us by messaging [Krzysztof ](https://t.me/kaereste)or [Sinkas](https://t.me/Sinkas5) on Telegram.


### **[RFC] Grant Proposal for migration of DATA2073 TCG**

Marco Mai, the CEO of Osten Games, [submitted an RFC](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/grant-proposal-for-migration-of-data2073-tcg/23644) that seeks to request a grant of 150,000 ARB to deploy the trading card game DATA2073 on Arbitrum/Treasure. 

The proposal includes a lot of information on the game’s roadmap but doesn’t offer a lot of information on what has been achieved so far, including whether the game is already deployed elsewhere, and what the user base looks like if it has.

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

We’re interested in hearing other delegates’ perspectives on what the ARDC should work on apart from what we already are. There have been numerous discussions in the context of different proposals that there isn’t enough relevant data, or nobody to do the work of reviewing them and draw conclusions. With the ARDC, we have an entity that can do both, so we should make sure we put it to good use as a DAO.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss all of the above and more during our [Arbitrum Office Hours](meet.google.com/jkj-nnop-arc) every Thursday at 3 pm UTC.


## **Uniswap**


### **[RFC] Deploy Uniswap v3 on Redstone**

Virtualelena [submitted an RFC](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/deploy-uniswap-v3-on-redstone/23824) that seeks to deploy Uniswap v3 on Redstone, a new L2 designed especially for applications built with MUD and autonomous worlds, to facilitate the exchange of in-game assets that are beginning to propagate within on-chain apps and autonomous worlds on Redstone. 


### **[RFC] Uniswap Delegate Reward**

Doo from StableLabs [submitted an RFC](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temp-check-uniswap-delegate-reward/23837) that outlines the Uniswap Delegate Reward Initiative, a compensation program designed to improve participation quality and dedication among Uniswap delegates. The proposed program would be for 21 delegates, and the amount per month would be between $2,000 and $6,000 depending on a number of eligibility criteria.


### **Uniswap Foundation: Summary 2023 Financials**

Nataliara, the new Head of Finance at the Uniswap Foundation, [published a post](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-foundation-summary-2023-financials/23829) announcing that in the spirit of providing financial transparency to the community, the Uniswap Foundation will start a regular cadence of financial updates starting with the summary results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

We participated in the delegate rewards working group and helped with the research around the topic. Delegate rewards have the potential to increase governance participation, and we’d be interested in discussing [the working group findings](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/findings-from-uniswap-delegate-reward-working-group/23702) with other delegates who might have feedback on the structure of the proposal by Doo.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss all the above and more during our [Uniswap Office Hours](http://meet.google.com/twm-jafw-esn) every Friday at 3 pm UTC.

## **Polygon**


### **[RFC] PIP-35 MinGas Increase**

Marcello Ardizzone from Polygon Labs [submitted a proposal](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-35-mingas-increase/13856) that seeks to eliminate client-level config for parameters such as the minimum fee for transactions, the miner gas fee, and the transaction pool price limit, and instead add them as part of the protocol hardcoded params, with a default value of 30gwei.


### **[RFC] PIP-36: Replay Failed State Syncs**

[This PIP](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-36-replay-failed-state-syncs/13864) proposes to patch the transfer vs send bug mentioned above by updating the bytecode of MRC-20 MATIC token on L2 through a hardfork. We specify a txGasLimit while doing the call such that the receiver doesn’t consume all available gas in the state sync block limit to prevent DoS (state syncs are batched together in one txn).


### **[RFC] PIP-37: Ahmedabad Hardfork**

[This PIP](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-37-ahmedabad-hardfork/13885) specifies the changes included in the Polygon PoS hard fork named Ahmedabad. Specifically, the included changes in Ahmedabad are:



* PIP-30: Increase Max Code Size Limit to 32KB
* PIP-22: EIP-3074-style Account Abstraction
* PIP-36: Replay Failed State Syncs
* PIP-35: MinGas Increase

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

## **Connext**


### **[RFC] Long-Term Marketing Collaboration for Education and Distribution of Content Around the Connext Ecosystem**

[This RFC](https://forum.connext.network/t/title-long-term-marketing-collaboration-for-education-and-distribution-of-content-around-the-connext-ecosystem/1172) submitted by Joshua outlines a long-term marketing collaboration between the Connext DAO and Nebula Agency, aiming to enhance awareness and understanding of Connext’s protocol through education and content distribution in partnership with key opinion leaders (KOLs) in the space. The proposed duration for the collaboration is a minimum of 6 months, and the amount requested by Nebula is 5,015,000 $NEXT.

**Discuss with L2BEAT**

This is the third marketing-related proposal we’ve had in the past 2 months or so. Perhaps it’s time to start thinking about a standard framework/approach to similar partnerships in the future to avoid delegate fatigue. We’d be interested in collaborating with other delegates who would be interested in creating such a framework.

**When/where to catch us:**

You can find us to discuss the above and more during our [Connext Office Hours](meet.google.com/twm-jafw-esn) every Friday at 3 pm UTC.
