          </h2>
          <div>
            In recent years the Ethereum L2s ecosystem has grown tremendously in
            terms of the number of available systems, the number of different
            system architectures, and their complexity. As a direct consequence,
            a deeper understanding of the management mechanisms of these systems
            has grown increasingly important. Almost all present-day L2s are
            equipped with some form of upgrade mechanism, whether a code
            implementation upgrade or system parameters update. Given that these
            systems are in their relative infancy and continue to evolve,
            it&apos;s reasonable to expect that these upgrade mechanisms will
            remain an essential aspect of L2s for the foreseeable future.

            This report is a snapshot of our current knowledge as of June 2023.
            In the report, we delve into various aspects of system
            upgradeability. We start with why and when we need Layer 2s to be
            upgradable, both from a user’s and an operator’s perspective. We go
            through different aspects that need to be considered when thinking
            about code upgradeability and managing system parameters, and we
            finish with our recommendations regarding the design of the systems
            architecture and safety measures. Attached at the end, you will find
            our analysis of 8 existing L2s and how they approached
            upgradeability and management. For every project, we focus primarily
            on the technical and organizational aspects, leaving away
            considerations regarding the governance structures and processes.
