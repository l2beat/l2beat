## Description

Two previously-unverified contracts are now verified. 
The only registered strategy backing reETH is currently depositing ETH into Lido and holding stETH. There is a SwapManager that serves instant withdrawals through Curve and Uniswap.

All escrowing and strategy-related contracts have a new Multisig as governance, but the ownership transfer is still pending. (the EOA Warning is now removed).
