How to upgrade contracts?

- UpgradeGatekeeper - immutable
- TokenGovernance - immutable
- NftFactory - immutable
- ZkSyncMultisig - n / a

- ZkSync, Governance, Verifier - all at once through UpgradeGatekeeper

1. From MSig call startUpgrade and specify newTargets
  - sets newTargets
  - starts notice period based on main contract (ZkSync.noticePeriod = 0!)
  - calls mainContract (ZkSync.upgradeNoticePeriodStarted())

At any point upgrade can be cancelled by MSig by calling cancelUpgrade

1.5. Security council members in turn sign or call approveCutUpgradeNoticePeriod. Once enough signatures are collected, approvedUpgradeNoticePeriod is set to zero.
  - NOTE: security council cannot cancel upgrade

2. From MSig call startPreparation
  - needs to be after notice period, but because notice period is zero it can be called immediately after startUpgrade
  - calls mainContract (ZkSync.upgradePreparationStarted())
    - checks approvedUpgradeNoticePeriod - 21 days or zero

3. From MSig call finishUpgrade and provide update parameters.
  - checks mainContract (ZkSync.isReadyForUpgrade())
  - checks mainContract (ZkSync.upgradeFinishes())

How to change upgrade parameters?

- (master) UpgradeGatekeeper - cannot be changed. Proxies have setup to change this but gatekeeper cannot call those functions.

- upgrade delay - only changed by upgrading main contract (ZkSync)

------

To view upgrade history you need to look at slots:
- target slots of each of the 3 proxies (ZkSync, Governance, Verifier)
- master slots of each of the 3 proxies
- upgradeStatus of UpgradeGatekeeper
- nextTargets of UpgradeGatekeeper
