## Description

OP stack in alt-DA mode, not using EigenDA currently (judging from the DA-service byte in the tx data commitments). Thus BasementDA with DA challenges. Challenges must be respected in the L2 node's derivation rule, which is not clear here, but we assume they use the standard node like xterio, redstone, cyber.

    contract OptimismMintableERC20Factory (0x34B4AcC9e4523Cc6bbfC367B9034121c447b4083)
    +++ description: A helper contract that generates OptimismMintableERC20 contracts on the network it's deployed to. OptimismMintableERC20 is a standard extension of the base ERC20 token contract designed to allow the L1StandardBridge contracts to mint and burn tokens. This makes it possible to use an OptimismMintablERC20 as this chain's representation of a token on the host chain, or vice-versa.

It manages the `PAUSED_SLOT`, a boolean value indicating whether the local chain is paused, and `GUARDIAN_SLOT`, the address of the guardian which can pause and unpause the system.
