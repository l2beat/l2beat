## Description

The initial diverging node is now [rejected](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xeddeaed1b11b112b6131993a9a9149297d280312fed6969176249949bc3e3158) and the losing validator churned (un-zombified). Since they stay whitelisted as a validator and are not a zombie anymore, they can propose/challenge again whenever needed.

During the challenge, all validators except hypernative took part, Kinto says they were in 'watchtower' mode and not defensive.

## Description

Kinto Decentralization upgrade:

### Stage 1 TODO:
Guarantee a KintoWallet user on L2 to be able to exit their funds. Context:
- kinto-geth [censors all EOA->contract calls on L2](https://github.com/KintoXYZ/kinto-go-ethereum/blob/kinto/core/kinto.go#L23C53-L23C95) and forces users into smartWallet usage
- KintoWallet is upgradeable: `isKYC` flag can be changed by actors more centralized than SC
- KintoWallet verifies `isKYC` on every transaction

### Security Council
The multisig at `0x17Eb10e12a78f986C78F973Fc70eD88072B33B7d` has the EXECUTOR_ROLE and meets the minimum requirements for a Security Council. Members are published [here](https://docs.kinto.xyz/kinto-the-safe-l2/security-kyc-aml/security-council) (5 external members, including Caldera).

## Description

Challenge undergoing awaiting oneStepProver resolution. Also updated discovery for template. Kinto on telegram confirmed that this challenge was the result of ankr (the 0x2bfDA validator) did not upgrade their software in time for the HF 7 and thus challenged a correct state.

The ExecutorMultisig is being transformed into a SecurityCouncil with 5 public external members. It is currently 6/9 and would need one less Kinto-owned signer to meet the requirements.

## Description

Kinto [HF 7 upgrade](https://github.com/ConstellationCrypto/kinto-go-ethereum/pull/11). Kinto uses a custom wasmModuleRoot but this upgrade loosely corresponds to ArbOS v32 in that L1 contract implementations are the same.

## Description

The Bridger (Gateway) contract is upgraded to support new assets (USDM) and deposit by PERMIT2 (`depositPermit2()` function). USDM is now also a supported finalAsset (outcoming asset) for swapping through the Bridger.

The Socket escrow for USDM is not yet used and will be added as soon as it has TVL.

- current block number: 19926394

## Description

The Bridger is upgraded to a new implementation. Currently there are no funds in it as the prelaunch-farm (Engen) has concluded and assets were [bridged](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xbbdbbf2f7ddd1ac994d9a96b2da163e72339866dee3dbac7004fe4a64ee26f92) via socket to the Kinto L2.

### Bridger.sol

The logic of the Bridger is still a Gateway contract to the Kinto L2. As the prelaunch phase has concluded, ERC-20 tokens can now be deposited to the Bridger and are bridged directly to the L2, so the Bridger will not escrow assets anymore. It also now uses a 0x exchange proxy to swap into 'final assets' before depositing. Final assets for Kinto can be defined by the depositer and can also be the inputAsset, in which case no swap is performed and the asset is bridged directly. The bridge address is supplied with the call to `depositERC20()`.

## Description

The Bridger contract (pre-launch escrow for Kinto) is upgraded: The hardcoded orbitstack-native bridges are removed and the bridgeDeposits() function is modified to allow bridging via arbitrary bridges. Kinto will use socket as an external bridge for their L2 and the assets currently locked in the Bridger contract.

## Description

The wasmModuleRoot changes to a new value (which is not known in our ArbOS history). Looking at the Kinto Github repo, this is the [Hardfork #4 upgrade](https://github.com/ConstellationCrypto/kinto-go-ethereum/pull/4).
Changes are mainly related to the integration of the Socket bridge contracts in preparation for the May 22nd 'full mainnet launch'.

## Description

The Inbox contract is upgraded with a minor change:

The l2AllowList that gets checked by the `whenRefundAddressAllowed` modifier is now settable by the owner or rollup contract whereas it was hardcoded before.

## Description

The Inbox implementation is upgraded with very minor changes:
- Modifier `whenRefundAddressAllowed` added (ensures that both `excessFeeRefundAddress` and `callValueRefundAddress` match the msg.sender unless they are whitelisted in `isAllowed`)
- `whenRefundAddressAllowed` is used by `createRetryableTicket()` and `createUnsafeRetryableTicket()`
- Formatting and import folder structure
