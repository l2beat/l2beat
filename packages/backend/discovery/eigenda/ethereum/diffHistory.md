## Description

The OperationsMultisig updated the ejectionCooldown param, and quorumEjection params for quorum 0 (ETH) and quorum 1 (EIGEN). 
Shortened ejectionRateLimitWindow and ejectionCooldown to 3 days, so that max 33% of the stake can be ejected in a 3-day window, and ejected operators can rejoin after 3 days from being ejected.
Added description for ejectionCooldown value in config.

## Description

Added shapes to strategy template to automatically apply the template. Templetized ignoring eigen() token method to prevent custom strategy from spamming.

## Config/verification related changes

Following changes come from updates made to the config file,
or/and contracts becoming verified, not from differences found during

- current block number: 20454476

## Description

This eigenDAServiceManager implementation upgrade prepared for the ability of AVSs to reward stakers and operators. Apart from that, only formatting and abstraction changes:
- New `ServiceManagerBaseStorage` abstract contract (moved out from `ServiceManagerBase`)
- New `createAVSRewardsSubmission` function and `onlyRewardsInitiator` modifier to call it: This allows AVSs to reward stakers and operators (https://www.blog.eigenlayer.xyz/coming-soon-avs-rewards-and-eigen-programmatic-incentives/)
- `IServiceManagerUI` abstracted out of `IServiceManager`

## Description

RegistryCoordinator upgrade: two new variables lastEjectionTimestamp, and ejectionCooldown. Once ejected, operators now need to wait for the cooldown period to end before they can reregister (currently 7 days).

## Description

Registry coordinator:
    - Ejector address was changed from the EigenLayerOperationsMultisig to the EjectionManager

eigenDAServiceManager:
    - New EjectionManager contract
    - quorumNumbersRequired - second quorum (EIGEN token) now active

EjectionManager:
- used to eject validators from quorum
- permissioned, only ejectors and owner can eject operators
- operators to eject are external input provided by ejector
    Ejection spec parameters: 
        - Max 200 operators for each quorum. When the global operator cap (200) is reached for the quorum, the joining operator must have more than 1.1X the quorum weight of the current lowest-weighted operator in order to replace that operator.
        - RateLimitWindow and max EjectableStakePercent. There is a time delta (7 days) to track ejection over. SC checks that system cannot eject more than ejectableStakePercent (33.33%) of total stake in this time delta.

## Description

Only implementation change is the BLOCK_STALE_MEASURE constant variable, from 150 to 300. This is the maximum amount of blocks in the past that the service will consider stake amounts to still be 'valid'. If a batch is signed by a certain amount of stake, it then needs to be submitted within the next 300 blocks, or the confirmBatch function will revert.

quorumAdversaryThresholdPercentages and quorumConfirmationThresholdPercentages are currently unused in the smart contracts. They might be called by off-chain workers.

## Description

- getRestakeableStrategies: From EL: Added bEIGEN-Strategy. This is an extended `BaseStrategy` smart contract that will be used for staking bEIGEN. (It also allows EIGEN but will unwrap it for you on deposit)

- Second quorum - Added tracking of new quorum parameters. The second quorum uses EIGEN strategy (0xaCB55C530Acdb2849e6d4f36992Cd8c9D50ED8F7) for stake calculation in the stake registry.
