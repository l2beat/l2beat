## Description

- getRestakeableStrategies: From EL: Added bEIGEN-Strategy. This is an extended `BaseStrategy` smart contract that will be used for staking bEIGEN. (It also allows EIGEN but will unwrap it for you on deposit)

- Second quorum - Added tracking of new quorum parameters. The second quorum uses EIGEN strategy (0xaCB55C530Acdb2849e6d4f36992Cd8c9D50ED8F7) for stake calculation in the stake registry.
