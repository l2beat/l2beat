## Description

A `version` variable of MessageProxyForMainnet has been bumped up
from 1.5.0 to 2.1.0 with no changes to implementation.

This `version` variable can be arbitrarily changed by the owner
(emitting `VersionUpdated` event), but it doesn't seem to
have any impact on contracts in the project.
