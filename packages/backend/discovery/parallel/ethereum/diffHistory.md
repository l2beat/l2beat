## Description

Discovery rerun on the same block number with only config-related changes.

## Config/verification related changes

Following changes come from updates made to the config file,
or/and contracts becoming verified, not from differences found during
discovery. Values are for block 20842798 (main branch discovery), not current.

## Description

Parallel had a 11d gap between batches delivered to the SequencerInbox. The sequencer-only window was 2d, so `forceInclusion()` should have been possible. (nobody used it)

The proposer was active and has a much longer max inactivity before allowing self-proposing (~12d).

Paradex is currently using the ArbOS 31 wasmmoduleroot but not the new ChallengeManager nor the OSP contracts seen in Arbitrum.

- current block number: 20539980

## Description

The futureBlocks value enforces a max block height that a batch can be posted relative to the current block (likewise with futureSeconds). A small value for future blocks means that a relatively small L1 reorg can cause an otherwise valid batch to revert. They increased is to 96, or three epochs. The futureSeconds value is set to correspond to the new futureBlocks value. The delay is also changed - it's the delay time between tx submission and ability to do force inclusion on the L1. Compared to Arbitrum One all of the delays are higher here.

## Description

Conduit multisig is removed from permissions and replaced by an EOA. The single validator is replaced.
There is one batch posted with calldata and the Sequencer only window is increased and then reset again to the old value. (`maxTimeVariation.delaySeconds`)
The wasmModuleRoot is changed to the ArbOS 31 root. ([compare Nitro GH repo](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/7defbd2f59ffc53229eddaa5d6588e1a81ed90ff/Dockerfile#L220))

## Description

The implementation of SequencerInbox was upgraded to a differenct contract with identical code.
This was done to change the immutable boolean `isUsingFeeToken` to false. This immutable should indeed be false on ethereum mainnet as it signifies the base L1 using a custom fee token. (Used as a check for `submitBatchSpendingReport()` function that is needed for fee sequencer fee reimbursement)

## Description

### New deploys

OneStepProofEntry, OneStepProverHostIo, OneStepProverMath, OneStepProver0, OneStepProverMemory are redeployed and Reader4844 is added to be compatible with EIP-4844.

- OneStepProverHostIo: Compatibility with EIP-4844, most updates are KZG-related in function `executeReadPreImage()`; new function `modExp256()`
- Reader4844.sol: New unverified contract with the functions `getBlobBaseFee()`, `getDataHashes()` for reading blob data (hashes) (info from its interface)

### SequencerInbox

In general most updates are EIP-4844 related, also the new role `batchPosterManager` is added and there are new checks regarding native tokens.

- Batch data flag-based decoding refined for blobs: `DATA_AUTHENTICATED_FLAG`, `BROTLI_MESSAGE_HEADER_FLAG`, `DAS_MESSAGE_HEADER_FLAG`, `DATA_BLOB_HEADER_FLAG`, `TREE_DAS_MESSAGE_HEADER_FLAG`, `ZERO_HEAVY_MESSAGE_HEADER_FLAG`
- new `batchPosterManager` functions and role: Can change the Sequencer addresses. (allows key rotation of batch posters)
- new `addSequencerL2BatchFromOrigin()` (with added `prevMessageCount, newMessageCount` in sig, old signature without them is now deprecated), `addSequencerL2BatchFromBlobs()`
- Gas refunds fetch blob price from Reader4844
- Rollup owner can update rollup address
- SequencerInbox contructor reverts if host chain is Arbitrum because blobs are not supported there
  - Checks for fee token usage and reverts if the native token is not ETH
- `forceInclusion()` now does not change the sequencer message count
- IBridge interface is introduced to use the vars TimeBounds and BatchDataLocation
- Hashing functions for blobs vs. calldata
- Time variation boundaries for batch posting vs. force inclusion -> format change

### Changed wasmModuleRoot

Upgrade L2 system to [ArbOS Version 20 "Atlas"](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-arbos-version-20-atlas/20957)
