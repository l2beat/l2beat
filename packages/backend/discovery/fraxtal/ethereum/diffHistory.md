Two signers are added to frxETHMultisig. 
One minter is removed from frxETH, leaving frxETHMinter as the only minter. A new owner is nominated for frxETH (would transfer the ownership from frxETHMultisig to a timelock)

## Description

### Immutables now variable

This upgrade is touching all major contracts of the rollup system, with only minor changes to immutables, identical to the [Optimism Upgrade Proposal #6: Multi-Chain Prep (MCP) L1](https://gov.optimism.io/t/upgrade-proposal-6-multi-chain-prep-mcp-l1/7677)

The new implementations are code-identical to the optimism upgrade on which comments can be found in optimisms diffHistory.md under 'Diff at Fri, 12 Apr 2024 12:08:01 GMT'. Only exception is the customized OptimismPortal (FraxchainPortal) by Fraxtal. But that one has again the optimism changes, just merged.
