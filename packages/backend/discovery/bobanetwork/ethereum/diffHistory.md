## Description

Boba multisig withdraws ~18 ETH from their custom 'Lightbridge' contract and transfers it to an EOA in a second transaction. The Lightbridge is just an escrow controlled by BobaMultisig which currently allows ETH and BOBA to be bridged to Boba network as EBV. The new EOA seems to relay assets when users withdraw via the Lightbridge.

## Description

Boba upgrades to the Bedrock architecture (they call the upgrade 'Anchorage') on OP stack. The contracts have very similar logic with other op stack L2s and highest similarity-score with karak.
Smart contract versions are the latest (some newer than optimism). Boba is allegedly using a multi-client setup (erigon and geth, to be researched).
The Governance is currently fully relying on one single 3/4 Multisig, who is the ProxyAdmin.
