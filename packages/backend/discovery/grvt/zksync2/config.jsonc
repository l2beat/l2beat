// NOTE(radomski): This is a hack to make tests in the config pass. The problem
// is that we have a very naive handling of shared modules. If we use a
// shared-module on chain1 but my project is on chain2 I can only link to a
// shared-module on chain2. In the case of zkStack there is a shared-module on
// zksync2 that is used in the .ts files of all zkStack projects. While
// checking  address verification we fail because we don't see that
// shared-module on zksync2. This should be resolved when we handle
// shared-modules better.
