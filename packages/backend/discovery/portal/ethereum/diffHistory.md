## Description

Now emits an event (event TransferRedeemed) upon token transfer completion by the bridge. The `initialize()` function of the BridgeImplementation has been gutted and now does nothing. Because of that it seems like the current version of the code is incapable of changing the implementation address of the TokenContract. The `IWormhole.sol` interface has been expanded by additional functions and events plus the structs that were in `Structs.sol` have been moved to it as well.
