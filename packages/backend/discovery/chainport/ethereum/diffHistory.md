## Description

Executed two proposalas 46 and 47.
The first one according to the description submitted by the Chainport Congress aims to: "Deploy Arbitrage, Upgrade Main and Side Bridge and add new Maintainer".
While the second one wants to: "Refund HODL tokens".

In the process the implementation of the Vault changed, since this contract is unverfied it's impossible to analyze what has really happened.
