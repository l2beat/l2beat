## Description

Liveness value in the HubPool (token escrow) is decreased from 1,5 to 1h. This is the time before a subitted root bundle is finalized and cannot be disputed anymore (And when relayers are reimbursed with tokens).

## Description

- added Linea support
- SpokePool upgrade: various functions to register orders, updated to V3 specs. // does it use merkle proofs to withdraw funds?
  Plus some counters of filled orders and deposits. These counters are designed to implement a fee mechanism that is based on a canonical history of deposit and fill events and how they update a virtual running balance of liabilities and assets, which then determines the LP fee charged to relays. Plus some error handling, handling of non-expiring deposits.

Workflow - from the contract:
Request to bridge input token cross chain to a destination chain and receive a specified amount of output tokens. The fee paid to relayers and the system should be captured in the spread between output amount and input amount when adjusted to be denominated in the input token. A relayer on the destination chain will send outputAmount of outputTokens to the recipient and receive inputTokens on a repayment chain of their choice. Therefore, the fee should account for destination fee transaction costs, the relayer's opportunity cost of capital while they wait to be refunded following an optimistic challenge window in the HubPool, and the system fee that they'll be charged. On the destination chain, the hash of the deposit data will be used to uniquely identify this deposit, so modifying any params in it will result in a different hash and a different deposit. The hash will comprise all parameters to this function along with this chain's chainId(). Relayers are only refunded for filling deposits with deposit hashes that map exactly to the one emitted by this contract.
