## Description

Signers added to Owner Multisig, threshold changed to 3/4. EOA warning is removed.

The DAChallenge contract has resolverRefundPercentage set to 100%. A successful resolve now gets `( fixedResolutionCost + preImageLength * variableResolutionCost / variableResolutionCostPrecision ) * block.basefee` as a refund. Depending on the other variables, a malicious Sequencer can now challenge itself infinitely without cost.
