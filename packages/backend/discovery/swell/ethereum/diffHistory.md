## Description

Initial config for the Pre-launch phase of swell. There are two main contracts:
- Zap: Non-escrowing entry contract that wraps ETH, eETH or stETH and deposits them into the Vault. It is immutable and has no owner functions.
- SwellL2PrelaunchVault: Escrow that can hold predefined ERC-20s and nothing more. It is immutable and owner functions (`rescueERC20()`) are currently proxied with a 2d timelock in front of the SwellMultisig.
