- current block number: 20017490

## Description

Added the accesscontrol of the AxelarBridgeAdaptor to discovery, but this changes nothing as the Multisig that is in the permissions section has full control. (as before)

Edit: removed the AxelarGasService contract from this discovery since it is shared infrastructure of the Axelar bridge on Ethereum. (unlike the Adaptor)

The AxelarGasService contract is upgraded, adding L2 gas estimator functions.

### AxelarGasService

The function `updateGasInfo()` is added, allowing a permissioned 'gas price oracle' to update the gas price for destination L2s.
The new `payGas()` function then allows bridgers to pre-pay the gas for arbitrary contract calls at the destination.
