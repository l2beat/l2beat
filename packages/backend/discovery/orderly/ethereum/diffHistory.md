## Description

Gas limit raise to 180M, the highest current limit on OP stack chains. With a block time of 2s and elasticity of 10x, this currently puts Orderly at 9 GGas/s on average. This is ~ 7x Ethereum Mainnet's 1,25 GGas/s and has a much higher surge scaling buffer. (elasticity)

Note: While orderly has ~ 80% higher Gas/s than base, base more regularly hits its target Gas/s, producing more high-usage data.
