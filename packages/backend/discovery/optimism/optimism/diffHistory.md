## Description

The changes are due to the [OP Mainnet 'Fjord' upgrade](https://gov.optimism.io/t/upgrade-proposal-9-fjord-network-upgrade/8236).

The GasPriceOracle predeploy is changed to use a FastLZ-based compression estimator for gas price estimation. (compare [the spec](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/blob/main/specs/protocol/fjord/exec-engine.md#fees))
