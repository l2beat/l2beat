## Description

Degen is upgraded to [ArbOS Version 20 "Atlas"](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-arbos-version-20-atlas/20957).
This upgrade comes with blobs support (but Degen is an L3 on Base) and was reviewed thoroughly in `packages/backend/discovery/arbitrum/ethereum/diffHistory.md` at "Diff at Fri, 22 Mar 2024 07:51:09 GMT:".

TLDR of changes:
- SequencerInbox changes are related to blobs support
- Critical values like maxTimeVariation in the SequencerInbox (self sequencing delay) stay the same
- ChallengeManager is the same except for pointing to new OneStepProof contract

## Description

This update extends the sequencer-only window for degen chain by 1000x to 1000d. (MaxTimeVariation.delayBlocks, maxTimeVariation.delaySeconds)
Context: Big chain reorg on the L2, no batches posted for the last ~30h.
