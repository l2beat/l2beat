## Description

The shared ZK stack contracts BridgeHub and StateTransitionManager (used by cronos and ZKsync Era) and also the ZKsync Era diamond proxy are moved to new admin contract called 'ChainAdmin' (owner is Matter Labs MS). The STM is upgraded to a new implementation with marginal diff (one added event).

The scheduled tx is immediately executed.

This upgrade does not change net permissions at the moment but will probably be used in the future once more ZK stack chains are used or something like a SecurityCouncil is added.

### New ChainAdmin contract

This contract is very simple with the most important functions being:
- `multicall` (onlyOwner): Does what the name suggests
- `setTokenMultiplier` (callable by `tokenMultiplierSetter`): Used for the custom gas tokens of ZK stack chains
- `setUpgradeTimestamp` (onlyOwner): sets a public expected upgrade timestamp for a new protocol version (like the one used for this upgrade `103079215106`), this var is only informative and not enforced so far

The contract is set as admin (NOT upgradeability admin, see upgrades&gov diagram) for the BridgeHub, the STM and the ZKsync Era diamond at the moment.
The Governance contract still has its former upgradeabilityAdmin role.

## Description

Initial discovery of the shared config.

Two governance transactions (no delay) add the new Cronos zkEVM (First ZK stack chain). It shares the StateTransitionManager, ValidatorTimelock and Verifier with ZKsync Era, thus sharing the L2 logic. For DA it uses ValidiumMode. (https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb2a1d8913ebe7b4a8a21064c994801ad036fc85da1f378f35b57956df72f0131)
Four new Validators are registered with the Timelock, of which two are removed, leaving two new ones and two each for ZKsync Era and Cronos zkEVM.

The Cronos DiamondProxy is not yet verified.
