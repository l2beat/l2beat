## Description

BridgeHub upgrade (one-line diff):
* `addToken()` (acts as a global token whitelist for the shared bridge) now can only be called by the owner (not the admin). Currently those two roles are still held by the same address anyway.

## Description

This update introduces a new ProtocolUpgradeHandler contract, with a new attached Governance system. The ProtocolUpgradeHandler is pendingOwner in all shared ZK stack contracts and will supposedly be used as the new owner of the central ProxyAdmin. It currently has no gov roles assigned (yet).

The L2 part of the Governance will be added in a separate config / PR.

### ProtocolUpgradeHandler.sol

Keeps track of the upgrade stages, executes upgrades, freezes contracts (all ZK shared contracts). (needs ProxyAdmin Owner and owner permissions)

Actors:
- L2 Timelock Governors: Initiate the upgrade proposal
- Guardians: Can extend legal veto period and/or approve within 30d delay
- Security Council: Can approve immediately after legal waiting (3d)
- Executor: Specified address that can execute the upgrade when ready

UpgradeState Enum:
- None: Initial state or non-existent upgrade
- LegalVetoPeriod: During the legal veto period
- Waiting: Waiting for approval by SC or Guardians
- ExecutionPending: Approved, waiting for execution delay (1d)
- Ready: Ready for execution
- Done: Upgrade executed
- Expired: Upgrade expired without execution
```

Apart from this non-emergency track, there is `executeEmergencyUpgrade()` which has no delay. For this, SC, ZK_FOUNDATION MS and Guardians must all approve. (Uses eip712 standard)

Delay with current vars: 
- L2 proposal, then SC: messageToL1delay+3d+1d = ~5d (The ProtocolUpgradeHandler calls `proveL2MessageInclusion()` which needs the upgrade message batch from L2 to be executed on L1, thus currently ~1d messageToL1delay)
- L2 Proposal, then Guardians: messageToL1delay+3d+30d+1d = ~35d
- L1 'emergency' proposal by SC, ZK_FOUNDATION MS, Guardians = No delay

### EmergencyUpgradeBoard.sol

Uses eip712 standard to check signatures from SC, ZK_FOUNDATION MS and Guardians to push emergency approvals through the ProtocolUpgradeHandler.

### SecurityCouncil

12 signers custom multisig (some signers are MS themselves) with varying thresholds for certain actions. (3-9) Has eip712 support.

### Guardians

8 signers custom multisig (all signers are 1/1 GnosisSafes) with eip712 support. `"APPROVE_UPGRADE_GUARDIANS_THRESHOLD": 5`

### ZK Foundation Safe

New 3/5 GnosisSafe currently only used in by the EmergencyUpgradeBoard.

### Various GnosisSafes in the diff

Belong to Guardians or SC signers, there are no superfluous contracts in the config.

- current block number: 20618759

## Description

The transactions were executed immediately and update the implementation of the shared bridge contract to introduce the ability to set an admin that can initialize new chains to the shared bridge (can set a chain's l2 bridge address) or add a new pending admin. The `onlyOwnerOrAdmin` is added for this purpose, so the two functions are also callable by the owner (matter labs gov).

## Description

The shared ZK stack contracts BridgeHub and StateTransitionManager (used by cronos and ZKsync Era) and also the ZKsync Era diamond proxy are moved to new admin contract called 'ChainAdmin' (owner is Matter Labs MS). The STM is upgraded to a new implementation with marginal diff (one added event).

The scheduled tx is immediately executed.

This upgrade does not change net permissions at the moment but will probably be used in the future once more ZK stack chains are used or something like a SecurityCouncil is added.

### New ChainAdmin contract

This contract is very simple with the most important functions being:
- `multicall` (onlyOwner): Does what the name suggests
- `setTokenMultiplier` (callable by `tokenMultiplierSetter`): Used for the custom gas tokens of ZK stack chains
- `setUpgradeTimestamp` (onlyOwner): sets a public expected upgrade timestamp for a new protocol version (like the one used for this upgrade `103079215106`), this var is only informative and not enforced so far

The contract is set as admin (NOT upgradeability admin, see upgrades&gov diagram) for the BridgeHub, the STM and the ZKsync Era diamond at the moment.
The Governance contract still has its former upgradeabilityAdmin role.

## Description

Initial discovery of the shared config.

Two governance transactions (no delay) add the new Cronos zkEVM (First ZK stack chain). It shares the StateTransitionManager, ValidatorTimelock and Verifier with ZKsync Era, thus sharing the L2 logic. For DA it uses ValidiumMode. (https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb2a1d8913ebe7b4a8a21064c994801ad036fc85da1f378f35b57956df72f0131)
Four new Validators are registered with the Timelock, of which two are removed, leaving two new ones and two each for ZKsync Era and Cronos zkEVM.

The Cronos DiamondProxy is not yet verified.
