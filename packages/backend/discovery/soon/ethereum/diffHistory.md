## Description

Initial discovery.

    SOON is a fairly standard OP Stack (with no proofs) with SVM as the execution environment
    all EVM addresses are changed to SOL addresses (byte32)
    ERC20 token transfers are not allowed, only ETH
    they are using EigenDA for DA with no bridge (no trace of Service Manager)
