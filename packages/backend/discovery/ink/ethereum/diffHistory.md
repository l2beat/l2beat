## Description

Contracts verified (PermissionedDisputeGame, AnchorStateRegistry).

Both contracts are unintented beta versions (see ink telegram chat) but contain mostly cosmetic changes and the diff is audited, according to ink. A brief review of the diff shows no logic changes and thus the standard templates are used here.
