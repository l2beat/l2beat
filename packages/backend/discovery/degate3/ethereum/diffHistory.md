## Description

The owner has accepted the ownership of the contract, which is now the same multisig used for upgrades. The EOA that was there before is now only the owner of the BlockVerifier, but it has no power since all the methods with the `onlyOwner` modifier have been deleted from Loopring's original codebase.

## Description

Owner is being changed. They are using Claimable instead of Ownable, which is the same thing but the new pending owner has to accept the ownership.
