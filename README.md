## License

We believe in knowledge sharing and open access. Our code is and will remain open source with the permissive MIT license.

## Versioning and publishing (tooling)

Some of the sub-packages are published to NPM. We use a tool called [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage versioning, cross-dependency versioning and publishing new versions to NPM.  When you make a change, before merging to master:

- run `yarn changeset` and mark the packages you wish to publish, select what kind of a change it is (major,minor,patch) and provide the summary of the changes

When you want to publish all previous changes to NPM:

- now run `yarn changeset version`, this will change the generated `.changeset/file.md` into an entry into `CHANGELOG.md` and `package.json` in changed packages

After your PR with changed `CHANGELOG.md` and `package.json` is merged into `main`, a CI step will run which will try to publish all change changes.
